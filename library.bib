  abstract =      {Comparative analyses of avian population fluctuations
                   have shown large interspecific differences in
                   population variability that have been difficult to
                   relate to variation in general ecological
                   characteristics. Here we show that interspecific
                   variation in demographic stochasticity, caused by
                   random variation among individuals in their fitness
                   contributions, can be predicted from a knowledge of
                   the species' position along a "slow-fast" gradient of
                   life-history variation, ranging from high
                   reproductive species with short life expectancy at
                   one end to species that often produce a single
                   offspring but survive well at the other end of the
                   continuum. The demographic stochasticity decreased
                   with adult survival rate, age at maturity, and
                   generation time or the position of the species toward
                   the slow end of the slow-fast life-history gradient.
                   This relationship between life-history
                   characteristics and demographic stochasticity was
                   related to interspecific differences in the variation
                   among females in recruitment as well as to
                   differences in the individual variation in survival.
                   Because reproductive decisions in birds are often
                   subject to strong natural selection, our results
                   provide strong evidence for adaptive modifications of
                   reproductive investment through life-history
                   evolution of the influence of stochastic variation on
                   avian population dynamics.},

                   invasions, the common life-history characteristics of
                   successful invaders remain elusive. The widely held
                   hypothesis that successful invaders have high
                   reproductive rates has received little empirical
                   support; however, alternative possibilities are
                   seldom considered. Combining a global comparative
                   analysis of avian introductions ({\textgreater}2700
                   events) with demographic models and phylogenetic
                   comparative methods, we show that although rapid
                   population growth may be advantageous during
                   invasions under certain circumstances, more generally
                   successful invaders are characterized by life-history
                   strategies in which they give priority to future
                   rather than current reproduction. High future
                   breeding expectations reduce the costs of
                   reproductive failure under uncertain conditions and
                   increase opportunities to explore the environment and

  volume =        {116},
  year =          {2007},
  abstract =      {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of
                   organismal performance, and this meaning of the term
                   has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over
                   the last three decades, developments in community and
                   ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait
                   beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based
                   approaches are now widely used in studies ranging
                   from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems.
                   Despite some attempts to fix the terminology,
                   especially in plant ecology, there is currently a
                   high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the
                   term “trait” itself, but also in the underlying
                   concepts it refers to. We therefore give an
                   unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a
                   particular emphasis on functional trait. A
                   hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the
                   “performance paradigm” to plant ecology.
                   “Functional traits” are defined as
                   morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact
                   fitness indirectly via their effects on growth,
                   reproduction and survival, the three components of
                   individual performance. We finally present an
                   integrative framework explaining how changes in trait
                   values due to environmental variations are translated
                   into organismal performance, and how these changes
                   may influence processes at higher organizational
                   levels. We argue that this can be achieved by
                   developing “integration functions” which can be
                   grouped into functional response (community level)
                   and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

  volume =        {20},
  year =          {2007},
  abstract =      {Trade-offs are a core component of many evolutionary
                   models, particularly those dealing with the evolution
                   of life histories. In the present paper, we identify
                   four topics of key importance for studies of the
                   evolutionary biology of trade-offs. First, we
                   consider the underlying concept of 'constraint'. We
                   conclude that this term is typically used too vaguely
                   and suggest that 'constraint' in the sense of a bias
                   should be clearly distinguished from 'constraint' in
                   the sense of proscribed combinations of traits or
                   evolutionary trajectories. Secondly, we address the
                   utility of the acquisition-allocation model (the
                   'Y-model'). We find that, whereas this model and its
                   derivatives have provided new insights, a
                   misunderstanding of the pivotal equation has led to
                   incorrect predictions and faulty tests. Thirdly, we
                   ask how trade-offs are expected to evolve under
                   directional selection. A quantitative genetic model
                   predicts that, under weak or short-term selection,
                   the intercept will change but the slope will remain
                   constant. Two empirical tests support this prediction
                   but these are based on comparisons of geographic
                   populations: more direct tests will come from
                   artificial selection experiments. Finally, we discuss
                   what maintains variation in trade-offs noting that at
                   present little attention has been given to this
                   question. We distinguish between phenotypic and
                   genetic variation and suggest that the latter is most
                   in need of explanation. We suggest that four factors
                   deserving investigation are mutation-selection
                   balance, antagonistic pleiotropy, correlational
                   selection and spatio-temporal variation, but as in
                   the other areas of research on trade-offs, empirical
                   generalizations are impeded by lack of data. Although
                   this lack is discouraging, we suggest that it
                   provides a rich ground for further study and the
                   integration of many disciplines, including the
                   emerging field of genomics.},

  abstract =      {The rate of reproduction, age at maturity and
                   longevity vary widely among species. Most of this
                   life-history variation falls on a slow–fast
                   continuum, with low reproductive rate, slow
                   development and long life span at one end and the
                   opposite traits at the other end. The absence of
                   alternative combinations of these variables implies
                   constraint on the diversification of life histories,
                   but the nature of this constraint remains elusive.
                   Here, we argue that individual and adaptive responses
                   to different environments are limited by
                   physiological mechanisms. Although energy and
                   materials allocations are important results of
                   physiological tradeoffs, endocrine control mechanisms
                   can produce incompatible physiological states that
                   restrict life histories to a single dominant axis of
                   variation. To approach the problem of life-history
                   variation properly, studies should integrate behavior
                   and physiology within the environmental and
                   demographic contexts of selection.},
  annote =        {To understand how physiology mediates the
                   relationship between life history and the
                   environment, we develop an argument founded upon five
                   principles: (1) individual organisms respond to
                   variation in their environments; (2) responses,
                   whether phenotypic or evolved, are constrained by the
                   allocation of limited resources among competing
                   functions; (3) individual organisms assume
                   alternative physiological states during their
                   lifetimes in part because such states are
                   incompatible; (4) organisms might also assume
                   alternative physiological states at any particular
                   stage of their life cycles based on responses to
                   environmental stressors and their individual
                   circumstances and (5) the assumption of one or
                   another physiological state can be modulated by the
                   demography of the population, particularly the
                   expectation of individual future reproduction.
                   Together, these principles create a way in which
                   physiological control mechanisms can constrain
                   patterns of variation in life histories and the
                   outcome of the phenotype-environment interaction},

                   behaviours have rarely been considered in the POLS
                   yet; (ii) the POLS could easily be applied to the
                   study of covariation among traits between individuals
                   within a population. In this paper, we propose that
                   consistent behavioural differences among individuals,
                   or personality, covary with life history and
                   physiological differences at the within-population,
                   interpopulation and interspecific levels. We discuss
                   how the POLS provides a heuristic framework in which
                   personality studies can be integrated to address how
                   variation in personality traits is maintained within
                   populations.},

                   designs organisms to achieve reproductive success.
                   The design is a solution to an ecological problem
                   posed by the environment and subject to constraints
                   intrinsic to the organism. Work on life histories has
                   expanded the role of phenotypes in evolutionary
                   theory, extending the range of predictions from
                   genetic patterns to whole-organism traits directly
                   connected to fitness. Among the questions answered
                   are the following: Why are organisms small or large?
                   Why do they mature early or late? Why do they have
                   few or many offspring? Why do they have a short or a
                   long life? Why must they grow old and die? The
                   classical approach to life histories was
                   optimization; it has had some convincing empirical
                   success. Recently non-equilibrium approaches
                   involving frequency-dependence, density-dependence,
                   evolutionary game theory, adaptive dynamics, and
                   explicit population dynamics have supplanted
                   optimization as the preferred approach. They have not
                   yet had as much empirical success, but there are
                   logical reasons to prefer them, and they may soon
                   extend the impact of life history theory into
                   population dynamics and interspecific interactions in

  abstract =      {The role of behaviour in evolutionary change has long
                   been debated. On the one hand, behavioural changes
                   may expose individuals to new selective pressures by
                   altering the way that organisms interact with the
                   environment, thus driving evolutionary divergence.
                   Alternatively, behaviour can act to retard
                   evolutionary change: by altering behavioural patterns
                   in the face of new environmental conditions,
                   organisms can minimize exposure to new selective
                   pressures. This constraining influence of behaviour
                   has been put forward as an explanation for
                   evolutionary stasis within lineages and niche
                   conservatism within clades. Nonetheless, the
                   hypothesis that behavioural change prevents natural
                   selection from operating in new environments has

                   the presence of an introduced predator, but that
                   these behavioural shifts do not prevent patterns of

                   diversification remains a major question in
                   evolutionary biology. Behavioural changes have long
                   been suggested to be a major driver of phenotypic
                   diversification by exposing animals to new selective
                   pressures. Nevertheless, the role of behaviour in
                   evolution remains controversial because behavioural
                   changes can also retard evolutionary change by hiding
                   genetic variation from selection. In the present
                   study, we apply recently implemented
                   Ornstein–Uhlenbeck evolutionary models to show that
                   behavioural changes led to associated evolutionary
                   responses in functionally relevant morphological
                   traits of pigeons and doves (Columbiformes).
                   Specifically, changes from terrestrial to arboreal
                   foraging behaviour reconstructed in a set of
                   phylogenies brought associated shorter tarsi and
                   longer tails, consistent with functional predictions.
                   Interestingly, the transition to arboreality
                   accelerated the rates of evolutionary divergence,
                   leading to an increased morphological specialization
                   that seems to have subsequently constrained reversals
                   to terrestrial foraging. Altogether, our results
                   support the view that behaviour may drive
                   evolutionary diversification, but they also highlight
                   that its evolutionary consequences largely depend on
                   the limits imposed by the functional demands of the
                   adaptive zone.},

                   weight is removed, brain weight is correlated with
                   maximum recorded life-span. In this paper we have
                   analyzed the relationships between volumes of
                   specific brain structures and life-span. When the
                   effect of body weight is removed, the volumes of many
                   brain structures are significantly, positively
                   correlated with maximum recorded life-span. However,
                   the volumes of the medulla and most first-order
                   sensory structures do not correlate with life-span.
                   The cerebellum is the brain structure that best
                   correlates with life-span. Parts of the cerebellum
                   are particularly vulnerable to age-related loss of
                   mass in humans. For another measure of the life
                   cycle, female reproductive age, a similar set of
                   brain structures is significantly, positively
                   correlated (again with the exceptions of the medulla
                   and most first-order sensory structures). There are
                   some differences between the structures correlated
                   for life-span and female reproductive age. For
                   example, the hippocampus and lateral geniculate
                   nucleus correlate with female reproductive age but do
                   not correlate with life-span. In strepsirhine
                   primates, when the effect of body weight is removed,
                   total brain weight does not significantly correlate
                   with either life-span or female reproductive age.
                   However, the volumes of some brain structures in
                   strepsirhines do correlate with these life-cycle
                   parameters. The centromedial complex of the amygdala
                   is the only structure to correlate with life-span in
                   both strepsirhine and haplorhine primates. This
                   structure participates in the regulation of blood
                   pressure and in the stress response, which may be key
                   factors governing life-span.},

                   classic answer is that a large brain facilitates the
                   construction of behavioural responses to unusual,
                   novel or complex socioecological challenges. This

  abstract =      {I outline how understanding the mechanism of
                   behavioural plasticity is important for predicting
                   how organisms will respond to rapidly changing and
                   novel environments. I define two major forms of
                   behavioural plasticity: developmental and
                   activational. Developmental plasticity refers to the
                   capacity of a genotype to adopt different
                   developmental trajectories in different environments.
                   Activational plasticity refers to differential
                   activation of an underlying network in different
                   environments such that an individual expresses
                   various phenotypes throughout their lifetime. I
                   suggest that the costs and benefits of these two
                   forms of behavioural plasticity may differ:
                   developmental plasticity is slow, but results in a
                   wider range of more integrated responses.
                   Furthermore, the neural costs associated with
                   activational plasticity may be greater because large
                   neural networks must be maintained past an initial
                   sampling and learning phase. While the benefits of
                   plasticity are realized in variable environments, I
                   argue that fine-grained and coarse-grained variation
                   may differentially select for activational and
                   developmental plasticity, respectively. Because
                   environmental variation experienced by an organism is
                   largely determined by behaviour, developmental
                   plasticity may still evolve in fine-grained
                   environments if niche choice results in
                   coarse-grained 'realized' variation. Behavioural
                   plasticity should impact evolution in novel
                   environments because it increases the chances of
                   survival in these environments. Developmental
                   behavioural plasticity may be particularly important
                   for diversification in novel environments because it
                   can impact not only survival, but also the
                   development of signals and preferences important in
                   mate choice. Future areas of research on behavioural
                   plasticity and rapid environmental change include

  abstract =      {While human-induced rapid environmental changes are
                   putting many organisms at risk of extinction, others
                   are doing better than ever. This raises the question
                   of why organisms differ in their tolerance to
                   environmental alterations. Here, we ask whether and
                   how behavioural adjustments assist animals in dealing
                   with the urbanization process, one of the primary
                   causes of biodiversity loss and biotic
                   homogenization. Based on a literature review, we
                   present both theoretical and empirical arguments to
                   show that behavioural adjustments to urban habitats
                   are widespread and that they may potentially be
                   important in facilitating resource use, avoiding
                   disturbances and enhancing communication. While a
                   growing number of studies report behavioural
                   differences between urban and nonurban animals, very
                   few studies directly address the underlying
                   mechanisms. In some cases, the changes in behaviour
                   occur very rapidly and involve learning, and hence
                   can be attributed to behavioural plasticity. In other
                   cases, however, it cannot be ruled out that
                   behavioural differences between urban and nonurban
                   animals result from natural selection or nonrandom
                   sorting of individuals by behavioural traits that
                   affect dispersal, habitat selection or establishment.
                   Because the urbanization process is expected to
                   continue to threaten biodiversity in the near future,
                   there is some urgency to improve our understanding of
                   the mechanisms through which behaviour helps animals
                   to cope with such environmental alterations.

  abstract =      {Species usually have to use indirect cues when
                   assessing habitat quality. This means that it is
                   possible for humans to alter habitats in a way that
                   causes a discrepancy between the cues and the true
                   quality of different habitats. This phenomenon is
                   called an ‘ecological trap'. Here we show that the
                   trap may lead to a behaviourally mediated Allee
                   effect, where population growth is reduced because of
                   non-ideal choices of individuals. The reduction is
                   greatest at low densities because more individuals
                   can choose their preferred habitat when competition
                   for breeding sites is reduced. An ecological trap may
                   lead to multiple equilibria in population dynamics
                   and cause deterministic extinction in habitats that
                   are capable of sustaining a viable population. We
                   also study the efficiency of three mechanisms that
                   may rescue a population from this extinction trap:
                   natural selection acting on habitat preferences and
                   two forms of phenotypic plasticity, experience-based
                   learning and a philopatric preference for the natal
                   habitat. Selection is most efficient in short-lived
                   species with large heritable variation in habitat
                   preferences, whereas in long-lived species, plastic
                   traits outperform genetically determined preferences.
                   The simple philopatric strategy generally produces
                   the most favourable outcome. It hardly differs from
                   the optimal strategy that assumes perfect and
                   immediate knowledge of habitat change, and is very
                   robust to non-ideal variation in the strength of
                   habitat preferences. We conclude that conservation
                   biologists need to ensure that cues for habitat
                   choice correlate with habitat quality.},

                   notion that brain volume and "intelligence" are
                   linked remains untested. Here, we use ecologically
                   relevant measures of cognitive ability, the reported
                   incidence of behavioral innovation, social learning,
                   and tool use, to show that brain size and cognitive
                   capacity are indeed correlated. A comparative
                   analysis of 533 instances of innovation, 445
                   observations of social learning, and 607 episodes of
                   tool use established that social learning,
                   innovation, and tool use frequencies are positively
                   correlated with species' relative and absolute
                   "executive" brain volumes, after controlling for

                   evolutionary tradeoff between reliance on individual

                   retention of, and acting upon information from the
                   environment. Avian cognition has been investigated by
                   the approaches of experimental psychology and in the
                   context of specific tasks, such as spatial memory.
                   However, the costs and benefits of cognitive ability
                   have not been considered in a life-history context. I
                   explore possible relationships between behaviors that
                   might indicate cognitive function and other
                   attributes, particularly brain size, rate of
                   development, age at maturity, and life span. Large
                   brain size and prolonged development are seen as
                   potential costs of intelligent behavior. Long life
                   span may permit the extended learning periods that
                   support experienced-based cognitive function. Play
                   behavior, which plausibly supports the development of
                   motor and social skills, and, to a lesser extent,
                   foraging innovations, are related to brain size. The
                   challenge of foraging in a spatially and temporally
                   varying environment, experienced for example by
                   pelagic seabirds, is associated with prolonged
                   embryonic development. Although these connections
                   lack mechanistic foundations, they suggest that
                   cognition can be considered as a part of the life
                   history of the individual and that potential costs of
                   cognition might provide guidelines for directing the
                   comparative study of intelligent behavior.},

                   of natural habitats, causing sudden adaptive
                   mismatches that make population persistence difficult
                   for many organisms. Urban contexts may be challenging
                   for adaptation, particularly for animals with long
                   generation times with slow evolutionary responses.
                   This chapter argues that cognition may play a major
                   role in facilitating evolutionary adaptation of
                   animals to the urban environment. By regulating how
                   animals gather, preserve, and use information,
                   cognition can influence adaptive evolution in urban
                   areas by (1) allowing individuals to choose the
                   habitats and resources that better match their
                   phenotypes, and (2) helping animals to construct
                   learned responses to challenges they have never or
                   rarely experienced before. These cognitive processes
                   can weaken the strength of selection. However, they
                   can also facilitate adaptive evolution by reducing
                   the risk of population extinction and by ensuring
                   that individuals are more gradually exposed to the
                   new conditions. In addition, cognitive processes can
                   maintain genetic diversity for selection to act upon
                   in the future as well as promoting local adaptation
                   by reducing gene flow with nearby non-urban
                   populations. Finally, learned behaviours can allow
                   the population to move close to the realm of
                   attraction of new adaptive peaks, driving evolution
                   toward novel directions. Cognition itself may also
                   evolve in urban areas—particularly in long-lived
                   generalists—if it exhibits enough heritable
                   variation. Echoing recent suggestions in cognitive
                   ecology, the chapter highlights the need to design
                   and carry out experiments explicitly designed to
                   assess the evolutionary consequences of cognition in
                   urban populations.},

                   led to the development of risk assessment
                   methodologies to identify potential invaders and
                   prevent future ecological and economic problems.
                   However, developing a risk assessment tool is
                   challenging because of the difficulties of accurately
                   predicting the outcomeof species introductions. 2. In
                   this study, we develop a global risk assessment for
                   birds. We integrate two approaches, generalized
                   linear mixed models (GLMM) and hierarchical tree
                   models, to help identify those introductions with the
                   highest risk of establishment success. 3. Past work
                   has shown that the number of individuals released is
                   the main factor influencing establishment success in
                   animals, a conclusion that was supported in our
                   analyses. Establishment success was also higher for
                   species with broader ecological niches and larger
                   brains relative to body size. These features should
                   increase the likelihood of finding an appropriate
                   niche in the region of introduction. 4. TheGLMMand
                   treemodel predicted the probability of establishment
                   success of birds inEurope and Australia with high
                   accuracy (over 80{\%}of introductions correctly
                   classified). This highlights that establishment risk
                   can be reasonably assessed with information on
                   general habitat use, brain size and the size of the
                   founder population.When comparedwith an alternative
                   risk assessment tool based on a qualitative ranking,
                   our quantitative approaches achieved higher accuracy
                   with less information. 5. Synthesis and applications.
                   Quantitative risk assessments based on traits related
                   to establishment success are difficult but feasible,
                   providing a useful tool for guiding preventive
                   polices aimed at mitigating the impact of invasive
                   species.},

                   most are innocuous. Given limited resources,
                   forecasting risks from alien species will help
                   prioritise management. Given that risk assessment
                   (RA) approaches vary widely, a synthesis is timely to
                   highlight best practices. We reviewed quantitative
                   and scoring RAs, integrating {\textgreater} 300
                   publications into arguably the most rigorous
                   quantitative RA framework currently existing, and
                   mapping each study onto our framework, which combines
                   Transport, Establishment, Abundance, Spread and
                   Impact (TEASI). Quantitative models generally
                   measured single risk components (78{\%} of studies),
                   often focusing on Establishment alone (79{\%}).
                   Although dominant in academia, quantitative RAs are
                   underused in policy, and should be made more
                   accessible. Accommodating heterogeneous limited data,
                   combining across risk components, and developing
                   generalised RAs across species, space and time
                   without requiring new models for each species may
                   increase attractiveness for policy applications.
                   Comparatively, scoring approaches covered more risk
                   components (50{\%} examined {\textgreater} 3
                   components), with Impact being the most common
                   component (87{\%}), and have been widely applied in
                   policy ({\textgreater} 57{\%}), but primarily
                   employed expert opinion. Our framework provides
                   guidance for questions asked, combining scores and
                   other improvements. Our risk framework need not be
                   completely parameterised to be informative, but
                   instead identifies opportunities for improvement in

                   dynamics from demographic information. Based on the
                   asymptotic population growth rate lambda, calculated
                   from a projection matrix model as a descriptor of the
                   population dynamics, we analyze published data of 49
                   species of birds to determine how lambda is
                   influenced by variation in different demographic
                   trails. Across species, the mean elasticity of the
                   adult survival rate was significantly larger than the
                   mean elasticity of the fecundity rate. The
                   contribution of the fecundity rate to the population
                   growth rate increased with increasing clutch size and
                   decreasing adult survival rare. while the greatest
                   contribution of adult survival rate occurred among
                   long-lived species that matured late and laid few
                   eggs. This represents a continuum from "highly
                   reproductive species" at one end to "survivor
                   species" at the other end. In addition, a high
                   contribution of adult survival rate was found in some
                   relatively long-lived species with early age at
                   maturity (and a large clutch size) which was assumed
                   to represent a bet-hedging strategy, i.e., producing
                   a large number of offspring in some occasional good
                   years. In a retrospective analysis. interspecific
                   differences in the effects of actual temporal
                   variation in adult survival rate and fecundity rates
                   on the variability of lambda were analyzed. These
                   effects are expected to be large when the variance or
                   the sensitivity of the trait is large. Because there
                   was a negative relationship among species, both for
                   the adult survival rate and the fecundity rate
                   between the variability and the sensitivity of the
                   trait, contribution of a trait to the variance in
                   lambda decreased with sensitivity. Similarly, within
                   species, less temporal variation was found in traits
                   with high elasticities than in traits with less
                   contribution to lambda. In some species, covariance
                   among matrix elements also influenced the
                   contribution of a demographic trait to lambda.
                   Monitoring schemes of bird demography should be
                   designed in such a way that temporal variances and
                   covariances among demographic traits can be

                   schemes to include data from a combination of traits

                   been altered, to some degree, by human activities.
                   Because behaviour mediates interactions between an
                   individual and its environment, the ability of
                   organisms to behave appropriately under these new
                   conditions is crucial for determining their immediate
                   success or failure in these modified environments.
                   While hundreds of species are suffering dramatically
                   from these environmental changes, others, such as
                   urbanized and pest species, are doing better than
                   ever. Our goal is to provide insights into explaining
                   such variation. We first summarize the responses of
                   some species to novel situations, including novel
                   risks and resources, habitat loss/fragmentation,
                   pollutants and climate change. Using a sensory
                   ecology approach, we present a mechanistic framework
                   for predicting variation in behavioural responses to
                   environmental change, drawing from models of
                   decision-making processes and an understanding of the
                   selective background against which they evolved.
                   Where immediate behavioural responses are inadequate,
                   learning or evolutionary adaptation may prove useful,
                   although these mechanisms are also constrained by
                   evolutionary history. Although predicting the
                   responses of species to environmental change is
                   difficult, we highlight the need for a better
                   understanding of the role of evolutionary history in
                   shaping individuals' responses to their environment

                   an account of what we have learned about the
                   evolution of life histories. Chapter 1 examines two
                   different approaches to analysis, the genetic
                   approach and the optimization approach. Though
                   genetic aspects are discussed throughout the book the
                   principal method of analysis is optimization. The
                   second half of chapter 1 discusses the broad scope of
                   constraints within which life histories can vary.
                   Though much can be achieved without explicit recourse
                   to genetic argument, a proper understanding of the
                   evolution of life histories necessitates an
                   appreciation of the implicit genetic assumptions.
                   These are discussed in chapter 2. Chapter 3 presents
                   the general framework of life history theory,

                   constraints on the evolution of life histories, do
                   they differ from lineage to lineage? I applied
                   principal component analysis and cluster analysis to
                   two data sets - 65 mammal species (14 orders, 30

                   orders, 64 families, 6 traits). In both data sets,
                   most of the covariation in life-his- tory traits
                   could be accounted for by the first two factors, and
                   in both data sets their interpretation was similar.
                   The first factor, accounting for 68-75{\%} of
                   covariation of life-history traits, ranked the
                   animals from early maturing, small, short-lived
                   animals with short gestation periods, many small
                   altricial young, and long lactation periods, to the
                   opposite suite of traits in large animals. The second
                   factor, accounting for 12-20{\%} of the covariation
                   in life-history traits, ranked the animals from
                   altricial to precocial. When order and family effects
                   were removed, the proportion of variance accounted
                   for by the first factor dropped 29-36{\%}, and the
                   number of high-level clusters in- creased. Analysis
                   within individual families revealed differences from
                   lineage to lineage in the loadings of each trait on
                   the first two principle factors. Weight alone
                   accounts for much of the tendency for mammals to be
                   arranged on a single axis ranging from early
                   maturing, highly fecund, and short-lived small
                   animals to the opposite. However, after the effects
                   of weight were removed, order and family effects
                   still had significant impact on patterns of
                   covariation. Thus morphological design, in addition
                   to size, may constrain life-history evolution. This
                   explains why earlier workers saw clear patterns of
                   covariation at high taxonomic levels whereas

                   organisms depend on their ability to survive changing
                   patterns of climate and environmental variation.
                   Among birds and mammals of different Antarctic
                   regions, including emperor penguins, snow petrels,
                   southern fulmars, Antarctic fur seals and Weddell
                   seals, we found strong support for selection of life
                   history traits that reduce interannual variation in
                   fitness. These species maximize fitness by keeping a
                   low interannual variance in the survival of adults
                   and in their propensity to breed annually, which are
                   the vital rates that influence most the variability
                   in population growth rate (k). All these species have
                   been able to buffer these rates against the effects
                   of recent climate-driven habitat changes except for
                   Antarctic fur seals, in the Southwest Atlantic. In
                   this region of the Southern Ocean, the rapid increase
                   in ecosystem fluctuation, associated with increasing
                   climate variability observed since 1990, has limited
                   and rendered less predictable the main fur seal food
                   supply, Antarctic krill. This has increased the
                   fitness costs of breeding for females, causing
                   significant short-term changes in population
                   structure through mortality and low breeding output.
                   Changes occur now with a frequency higher than the
                   mean female fur seal generation time, and therefore
                   are likely to limit their adaptive response. Fur
                   seals are more likely to rely on phenotypic
                   plasticity to cope with short-term changes in order
                   to maximize individual fitness. With more frequent
                   extreme climatic events driving more frequent
                   ecosystem fluctuation, the repercussions for life
                   histories in many Antarctic birds and mammals are
                   likely to increase, particularly at regional scales.
                   In species with less flexible life histories that are
                   more constrained by fluctuation in their critical
                   habitats, like sea-ice, this may cause demographic
                   changes, population compensation and changes in
                   distribution, as already observed in penguin species
                   living in the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent
                   islands.},

  abstract =      {Ecologists seek general explanations for the dramatic
                   variation in species abundances in space and time. An
                   increasingly popular solution is to predict species
                   distributions, dynamics, and responses to
                   environmental change based on easily measured
                   anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based
                   approaches assume that simple functional traits
                   influence fitness and life history evolution, but
                   rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking,
                   because they require quantitative information about
                   the full lifecycles of many species representing
                   different life histories. Here, we link a global
                   traits database with empirical matrix population
                   models for 222 species and report strong
                   relationships between functional traits and plant
                   life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived
                   leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with
                   mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more
                   strongly influenced by survival than by growth or
                   fecundity, compared with fast life history species
                   with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood.
                   In contrast to measures of demographic contributions
                   to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses
                   focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate
                   the strength of association between traits and mean
                   fitness. Our results help establish the physiological
                   basis for plant life history evolution and show the
                   potential for trait-based approaches in population

                   there is no consistently used definition of this
                   continuum. For example, some researchers include body
                   mass as one of the traits defining the continuum,
                   others factor it out by analysing body-mass
                   residuals, a third group performs both of these
                   analyses and uses the terms ‘‘fast'' and
                   ‘‘slow'' in both ways, while still others do not
                   mention body mass at all. Our analysis of European
                   and North American freshwater fish, mammals, and
                   birds (N = 2,288 species) shows the fundamental
                   differences between life-history patterns of raw data
                   and of body-mass residuals. Specifically, in fish and
                   mammals, the number of traits defining the continuum
                   decreases if body-mass residuals are analysed. In
                   birds, the continuum is defined by a different set of
                   traits if body mass is factored out. Our study also
                   exposes important dissimilarities among the three
                   taxonomic groups analysed. For example, while mammals
                   and birds with a ‘‘slow'' life history have a low
                   fecundity, the opposite is true for fish. We conclude
                   that our understanding of life histories will improve
                   if differences between patterns of raw data and of
                   body-mass residuals are acknowledged, as well as
                   differences among taxonomic groups, instead of using
                   the ‘‘fast–slow continuum'' too
                   indiscriminately for any covarying traits that appear
                   to suit the idea. Electronic},

                   strategies across the tree of life is essential to
                   our prediction of population persistence, extinction,
                   and diversification. Plants exhibit a wide range of
                   patterns of longevity, growth, and reproduction, but
                   the general determinants of this enormous variation
                   in life history are poorly understood. We use
                   demographic data from 418 plant species in the wild,
                   from annual herbs to supercentennial trees, to
                   examine how growth form, habitat, and phylogenetic
                   relationships structure plant life histories and to
                   develop a framework to predict population
                   performance. We show that 55{\%} of the variation in
                   plant life-history strategies is adequately
                   characterized using two independent axes: the
                   fast–slow continuum, including fast-growing,
                   short-lived plant species at one end and
                   slow-growing, long-lived species at the other, and a
                   reproductive strategy axis, with highly reproductive,
                   iteroparous species at one extreme and poorly
                   reproductive, semelparous plants with frequent
                   shrinkage at the other. Our findings remain
                   consistent across major habitats and are minimally
                   affected by plant growth form and phylogenetic
                   ancestry, suggesting that the relative independence
                   of the fast–slow and reproduction strategy axes is
                   general in the plant kingdom. Our findings have
                   similarities with how life-history strategies are
                   structured in mammals, birds, and reptiles. The
                   position of plant species populations in the 2D space
                   produced by both axes predicts their rate of recovery
                   from disturbances and population growth rate. This
                   life-history framework may complement trait-based
                   frameworks on leaf and wood economics; together these

  abstract =      {A major question in ecology is how age-specific
                   variation in demographic parameters influences
                   population dynamics. Based on long-term studies of
                   growing populations of birds and mammals, we analyze
                   population dynamics by using fluctuations in the
                   total reproductive value of the population. This
                   enables us to account for random fluctuations in age
                   distribution. The influence of demographic and
                   environmental stochasticity on the population
                   dynamics of a species decreased with generation time.
                   Variation in age-specific contributions to total
                   reproductive value and to stochastic components of
                   population dynamics was correlated with the position
                   of the species along the slow-fast continuum of
                   life-history variation. Younger age classes relative
                   to the generation time accounted for larger
                   contributions to the total reproductive value and to
                   demographic stochasticity in "slow" than in "fast"
                   species, in which many age classes contributed more
                   equally. In contrast, fluctuations in population
                   growth rate attributable to stochastic environmental
                   variation involved a larger proportion of all age
                   classes independent of life history. Thus, changes in
                   population growth rates can be surprisingly well
                   explained by basic species-specific life-history
                   characteristics.},

                   forms and life histories, yet comparatively few
                   essential trait combinations have proved
                   evolutionarily viable in today's terrestrial
                   biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six
                   major traits critical to growth, survival and
                   reproduction within the largest sample of vascular
                   plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy
                   of six-dimensional trait space is strongly
                   concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs.
                   Three- quarters of trait variation is captured in a
                   two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and
                   function. One major dimension within this plane
                   reflects the size of whole plants and their parts;

                   which balances leaf construction costs against growth
                   potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a
                   backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution,
                   for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems,

                   very large trees. Our algorithm solves the
                   traditional computational burden associated with two
                   key terms, namely the determinant of the phylogenetic
                   covariance matrix V and quadratic products involving
                   the inverse of V. Applications include Gaussian
                   models such as Brownian motion-derived models like
                   Pagel's lambda, kappa, delta, and the early-burst

                   models such as phylogenetic logistic regression,

                   generalized linear mixed models. Outside of

                   procedures (such as a size-correction and principal

                   processes that operate over both space and time and
                   thus require an integrated macroecological and
                   macroevolutionary perspective. Molecular time trees
                   have advanced our understanding of the tempo and mode
                   of diversification and have identified remarkable
                   adaptive radiations across the tree of life. However,
                   incomplete joint phylogenetic and geographic sampling
                   has limited broad-scale inference. Thus, the relative
                   prevalence of rapid radiations and the importance of
                   their geographic settings in shaping global
                   biodiversity patterns remain unclear. Here we
                   present, analyse and map the first complete dated
                   phylogeny of all 9,993 extant species of birds, a
                   widely studied group showing many unique adaptations.
                   We find that birds have undergone a strong increase
                   in diversification rate from about 50 million years
                   ago to the near present. This acceleration is due to
                   a number of significant rate increases, both within
                   songbirds and within other young and mostly temperate
                   radiations including the waterfowl, gulls and
                   woodpeckers. Importantly, species characterized with
                   very high past diversification rates are interspersed
                   throughout the avian tree and across geographic
                   space. Geographically, the major differences in
                   diversification rates are hemispheric rather than
                   latitudinal, with bird assemblages in Asia, North
                   America and southern South America containing a
                   disproportionate number of species from recent rapid
                   radiations. The contribution of rapidly radiating
                   lineages to both temporal diversification dynamics
                   and spatial distributions of species diversity
                   illustrates the benefits of an inclusive geographical
                   and taxonomical perspective. Overall, whereas
                   constituent clades may exhibit slowdowns, the
                   adaptive zone into which modern birds have
                   diversified since the Cretaceous may still offer
                   opportunities for diversification.},

                   predator attacks stimulate the rapid elevation of
                   circulating glucocorticoid hormones, triggering
                   physiological and behavioral responses that aid
                   immediate survival but simultaneously inhibit
                   reproduction. This stress response has been proposed
                   to serve as a physiological mediator of life-history
                   trade-offs: when the value of current reproduction is
                   high relative to the value of future reproduction and
                   survival, a mitigated stress response is expected to
                   enable successful breeding and maximize fitness.
                   Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, we
                   investigated baseline and peak stress-induced plasma
                   corticosterone levels during parental care in 64 bird
                   species. We found that (1) species with a higher
                   value of the current brood relative to future
                   breeding mounted weaker corticosterone responses
                   during acute stress, and (2) females in species with
                   more female-biased parental care had weaker
                   corticosterone responses. These results support the
                   brood value hypothesis, suggesting that the stress
                   response evolves as an adaptive basis for
                   life-history strategies. Further, we found that (3)
                   baseline corticosterone correlated positively with
                   brood value and negatively with body mass, and (4)
                   peak corticosterone was greater in species breeding
                   at higher latitudes. The latter findings suggest that
                   circulating corticosterone concentrations might be
                   matched to the anticipated demands and risks during
                   nesting.},

                   proportion of the variance in all the reproductive

                   reproductive traits showed a strong pattern of
                   covariation which divided the genera along a
                   "slow-fast continuum". On the one hand were found the

                   components of life histories appear to involve
                   important aspects of species biology, and the first
                   such component appears to be body size. We tested
                   whether the second major component of variation in

                   with short lives to long lives, the “fast–slow
                   continuum.” Mammalian populations (n = 143)
                   representing 109 species were examined, and life
                   histories were summarized using 5 key variables that
                   reflect reproduction and survival. Body size and
                   phylogeny were significant influences on life
                   histories. Once these influences were removed
                   statistically, a major axis of life history variation
                   that reflected the fast–slow continuum was revealed
                   in a principal components analysis. This component of
                   life history was poorly but significantly associated
                   with indices of the fast–slow continuum, such as
                   the ratio of reproduction to age at maturity and
                   generation time. Fast and slow species were
                   identified among several orders and families of
                   mammals, and one species exhibited fast and slow
                   populations. These results may indicate that fast and

                   mortality schedules as determinants in the evolution
                   of life-history characteristics. In this paper, we
                   compare patterns of mortality from natural
                   populations of mammals with a variety of life
                   histories. We find that, after removing the effects
                   of body weight, mortality is the best predictor of
                   variation in life-history traits. Mammals with high
                   levels of natural mortality tend to mature early and
                   give birth to small offspring in large litters after
                   a short gestation, before and after body size effects
                   are factored out. We examine the way in which
                   life-history traits relate to juvenile mortality
                   versus adult mortality and find that juvenile
                   mortality is more highly correlated with life-history
                   traits than is adult mortality. We discuss the
                   necessity of distinguishing between extrinsic sources
                   of mortality (e.g. predation) and mortality caused by
                   intrinsic sources (e.g. costs of reproduction), and
                   the role that ecology might play in the evolution of
                   patterns of mortality and fecundity. We conclude that
                   these results must be explained not simply in the
                   light of the demographic necessity of balancing
                   mortality and fecundity, but as a result of
                   age-specific costs and benefits of reproduction and
                   parental investment. Detailed comparative studies of
                   mortality patterns in natural populations of mammals
                   offer a promising avenue towards understanding the
                   evolution of life-history strategies.},

                   importance of considering a pace-of-life syndrome
                   (POLS) perspective to understand how animals interact
                   with their environment, studies relating behavior to
                   life history under altered environmental conditions
                   are still rare. By means of a comparative analysis of
                   flight initiation distances (i.e., the distance at
                   which an animal takes flight when a human being is
                   approaching) across {\textgreater} 300 bird species
                   distributed worldwide, we document here the existence
                   of a POLS predicted by theory where slow-lived
                   species tend to be more risk-averse than fast-lived
                   species. This syndrome largely emerges from the
                   influence of body mass, and is highly dependent on
                   the environmental context. Accordingly, the POLS
                   structure vanishes in urbanized environments due to
                   slow-lived species adjusting their flight distances
                   based on the perception of risk. While it is unclear
                   whether changes in POLS reflect plastic and/or
                   evolutionary adjustments, our findings highlight the
                   need to integrate behavior into life history theory
                   to fully understand how animals tolerate
                   human-induced environmental changes. Significance
                   statement: Animals can often respond to changing
                   environmental conditions by adjusting their behavior.
                   However, the degree to which different species can
                   modify their behavior depends on their life history
                   strategy and on the environmental context.
                   Species-specific perception of risk is a conspicuous
                   example of adjustable behavior tightly associated
                   with life history strategy. While there is a general
                   tendency of higher risk aversion in rural than
                   city-dwelling birds, it is dependent on the species'
                   life history strategy. Slow-lived species are more
                   prone to adjust their flight initiation distances
                   based on the perception of risk, allowing humans to
                   approach closer in urban than rural environments.
                   Behavior must therefore be taken into account
                   together with life history to reliably assess
                   species' vulnerability at the face of ongoing
                   environmental change.},

                   environments is fundamental to forecast organisms'
                   responses to global change, including biological
                   invasions and land use intensification. Novel
                   environments are challenging because they can cause
                   maladaptation, increasing the risk of extinction by
                   negative population growth. Animals can avoid
                   extinction by improving the phenotype–environment
                   match through behavioural responses, notably matching
                   habitat choice and learning. However, the demo-
                   graphic consequences of these responses remain
                   insufficiently understood in part because they have
                   not been analysed within a life-history context. By
                   means of an individual-based model, we show here that

                   life history to influence persistence in novel
                   environments. In maladaptive contexts, the likelihood
                   of persisting is higher for life-history strategies

                   offspring, even at the cost of decreasing
                   reproduction. Such a strategy facilitates persistence
                   in novel environments by reducing the costs of a
                   repro- ductive failure while increasing the benefits
                   of behavioural responses. Our results reinforce the
                   view that a more predictive theory for extinction
                   risk under rapid environmental changes requires
                   considering behavioural responses and life history as
                   part of a common adaptive strategy to cope with
                   environmental changes.},

                   strategy that has rarely been quantified in the wild
                   and for which drivers remain unclear. It may be the
                   result of a trade-off between survival and
                   reproduction, with individuals skipping breeding when
                   breeding conditions are below a certain threshold.
                   Heterogeneity in individual quality can also lead to
                   heterogeneity in intermittent breeding. We modelled
                   survival, recruitment and breeding probability of the
                   red-footed booby (Sula sula), using a 19 year
                   mark-recapture dataset involving more than 11,000
                   birds. We showed that skipping breeding was more
                   likely in El-Ni{\~{n}}o years, correlated with an
                   increase in the local sea surface temperature,
                   supporting the hypothesis that it may be partly an
                   adaptive strategy of birds to face the trade-off
                   between survival and reproduction owing to
                   environmental constraints. We also showed that the
                   age-specific probability of first breeding attempt
                   was synchronized among different age-classes and
                   higher in El-Ni{\~{n}}o years. This result suggested
                   that pre-breeders may benefit from lowered
                   competition with experienced breeders in years of
                   high skipping probabilities.},

                   current biodiversity loss, but the underlying causes
                   are not fully understood. It is generally assumed
                   that this loss reflects the fact that most organisms
                   do not tolerate well the environmental alterations
                   associated with urbanisation. Nevertheless, current
                   evidence is inconclusive and the alternative that the
                   biodiversity loss is the result of random mechanisms
                   has never been evaluated. Analysing changes in
                   abundance between urbanised environments and their
                   non-urbanised surroundings of {\textgreater} 800

                   the loss is associated with a lack of appropriate

                   extinction through adaptation by natural selection.
                   This process is called evolutionary rescue and has
                   been studied under different names in medicine,
                   agriculture, and conservation biology. It is a
                   component of the emerging field of eco-evolutionary
                   dynamics, which investigates how the ecological
                   attributes of species may evolve rapidly under strong
                   selection. Its distinguishing feature is to combine
                   the evolutionary concept of relative fitness with the
                   ecological concept of absolute fitness in a synthetic
                   theory of persistent adaptation. The likelihood of
                   rescue will depend both on attributes of the
                   population, particularly abundance and variation, and
                   on properties of the environment, particularly the
                   rate and severity of deterioration. Medical
                   interventions (e.g., the administration of
                   antibiotics), agricultural practices (e.g., the
                   application of pesticides), and population ecology
                   (e.g., the effects of species introductions) provide
                   numerous examples of evolutionary rescue. The general
                   theory of rescue has been tested in laboratory
                   experiments with microbes, in which experimental
                   evolution shows how different treatments affect the
                   frequency of rescue. Overall, these experiments have
                   supported the predictions of general theory: In
                   particular, abundance, variation, and dispersal have
                   pronounced and repeatable effects on the rescue of
                   populations and communities. Extending these
                   laboratory results to the field is a major task for
                   future research.},

  abstract =      {The initial response of individuals to human-induced
                   environmental change is often behavioural. This can
                   improve the performance of individuals under sudden,
                   large-scale perturbations and maintain viable
                   populations. The response can also give additional
                   time for genetic changes to arise and, hence,
                   facilitate adaptation to new conditions. On the other
                   hand, maladaptive responses, which reduce individual
                   fitness, may occur when individuals encounter
                   conditions that the population has not experienced
                   during its evolutionary history, which can decrease
                   population viability. A growing number of studies
                   find human disturbances to induce behavioural
                   responses, both directly and by altering factors that
                   influence fitness. Common causes of behavioural
                   responses are changes in the transmission of
                   information, the concentration of endocrine
                   disrupters, the availability of resources, the
                   possibility of dispersal, and the abundance of
                   interacting species. Frequent responses are
                   alterations in habitat choice, movements, foraging,
                   social behaviour and reproductive behaviour.
                   Behavioural responses depend on the genetically
                   determined reaction norm of the individuals, which
                   evolves over generations. Populations first respond
                   with individual behavioural plasticity, whereafter
                   changes may arise through innovations and the social
                   transmission of behavioural patterns within and
                   across generations, and, finally, by evolution of the
                   behavioural response over generations. Only a
                   restricted number of species show behavioural
                   adaptations that make them thrive in severely
                   disturbed environments. Hence, rapid human-induced
                   disturbances often decrease the diversity of native
                   species, while facilitating the spread of invasive
                   species with highly plastic behaviours. Consequently,
                   behavioural responses to human-induced environmental
                   change can have profound effects on the distribution,
                   adaptation, speciation and extinction of populations
                   and, hence, on biodiversity. A better understanding
                   of the mechanisms of behavioural responses and their
                   causes and consequences could improve our ability to
                   predict the effects of human-induced environmental
                   change on individual species and on biodiversity.

                   help conservation managers encourage released animals
                   to settle in appropriate habitats. By all measures,
                   success rates for captive-release and translocation
                   programs are low, and have shown few signs of
                   improvement in recent years. We consider situations
                   in which free-living dispersers prefer new habitats
                   that contain stimuli comparable to those in their
                   natal habitat, a phenomenon called natal habitat
                   preference induction (NHPI). Theory predicts NHPI
                   when dispersers experienced favorable conditions in
                   their natal habitat, and have difficulty estimating
                   the quality of unfamiliar habitats. NHPI is
                   especially likely to occur when performance in a
                   given habitat is enhanced if an animal developed in
                   that same habitat type. Animals exhibiting NHPI are
                   expected to rely on conspicuous cues that can be
                   quickly and easily detected during search, and to
                   prefer new habitats possessing cues that match those
                   encountered in their natal habitat. A major obstacle
                   to successful relocations is that newly released
                   animals often reject the habitat near the release
                   site and rapidly travel long distances away before
                   settling. An NHPI perspective argues that
                   long-distance movements away from release sites occur
                   because releasees prefer to settle in familiar types
                   of habitat, and reject novel areas lacking cues
                   similar to those in their habitat of origin.
                   Similarly, a preference by releasees for familiar
                   cues may encourage them to seek out inappropriate,
                   low quality habitats following release at a new
                   location. We review evidence from a number of studies
                   indicating that problems with habitat selection
                   behavior compromise conservation efforts, and provide
                   recommendations that may encourage animals to "feel
                   more at home" in post-release habitats. ?? 2006

                   uncertainty and by a change in the state of a
                   receiving organism. Thus, organisms can acquire
                   information about their environment that reduces
                   uncertainty and increases their likelihood of
                   choosing a best-matching strategy. We define the
                   ecology of information as the study of how organisms
                   acquire and use information in decision-making and
                   its significance for populations, communities,
                   landscapes and ecosystems. As a whole, it encompasses
                   the reception and processing of information,
                   decision-making, and the ecological consequences of
                   making informed decisions. The first two stages
                   constitute the domains of, e.g. sensory ecology and
                   behavioral ecology. The exploration of the
                   consequences of information use at larger spatial and
                   temporal scales in ecology has lagged behind these
                   other disciplines. In our overview we characterize
                   information, discuss statistical decision theory as a
                   quantitative framework to analyze information and
                   decision-making, and discuss potential ecological
                   ramifications. Rather than attempt a cursory review
                   of the enormity of the scope of information we
                   highlight information use in development, breeding
                   habitat selection, and interceptive eavesdropping on
                   alarm calls. Through these topics we discuss specific
                   examples of ecological information use and the
                   emerging ecological consequences. We emphasize
                   recurring themes: information is collected from
                   multiple sources, over varying temporal and spatial
                   scales, and in many cases links heterospecifics to
                   one another. We conclude by breaking from specific
                   ecological contexts to explore implications of
                   information as a central organizing principle,
                   including: information webs, information as a
                   component of the niche concept, and information as an
                   ecosystem process. With information having such an
                   enormous reach in ecology we further cast a spotlight
                   on the potential harmful effects of anthropogenic
                   noise and info-disruption. {\textcopyright} 2009 The

                   learning has traditionally been carried out on
                   vertebrates and bees. While less sophisticated than
                   those animals, fruit flies (Drosophila) are capable
                   of several forms of learning, and have the advantage
                   of a short generation time, which makes them an ideal
                   system for experimental evolution studies. This
                   review summarizes the insights into evolutionary
                   questions about learning gained in the last decade
                   from evolutionary experiments on Drosophila. These
                   experiments demonstrate that Drosophila has the
                   genetic potential to evolve a substantially improved
                   learning performance in ecologically relevant
                   learning tasks. In at least one set of selected
                   populations, the improved learning generalized to a
                   task other than that used to impose selection,
                   involving a different behavior, different stimuli,
                   and a different sensory channel for the aversive
                   reinforcement. This improvement in learning ability
                   was associated with reductions in other
                   fitness-related traits, such as larval competitive
                   ability and lifespan, pointing to evolutionary
                   trade-offs for improved learning. These trade-offs
                   were confirmed by other evolutionary experiments
                   where a reduction in learning performance was
                   observed as a correlated response to selection for
                   tolerance to larval nutritional stress or for delayed
                   aging. Such trade-offs could be one reason why fruit
                   flies have not fully used up their evolutionary
                   potential for learning. Finally, another evolutionary
                   experiment with Drosophila provided the first direct
                   evidence for the long-standing idea that learning can
                   under some circumstances accelerate and in others
                   slow down genetically based evolutionary change.
                   These results demonstrate the usefulness of fruit
                   flies as a model system to address evolutionary
                   questions about learning. {\textcopyright} The

                   the reproductive fitness of nesting birds if
                   disturbance reduces nest attentiveness, and
                   unattended eggs experience increased risk of
                   predation or exposure to potentially lethal
                   temperature extremes. Yet, relatively few studies
                   have examined the physiological or behavioural
                   mechanisms whereby disturbance influences
                   reproductive fitness, or the extent to which the
                   costs of disturbance may be reduced through
                   habituation. We compared the behavioural responses,
                   egg temperatures and reproductive success of
                   shore-nesting white-fronted plovers Charadrius
                   marginatus to disturbance at two breeding sites
                   experiencing low versus high human recreational
                   activity, respectively. Daytime nest attentiveness
                   decreased with increasing experimental disturbance at
                   both sites, but this relationship differed between
                   sites; for any given level of disturbance, incubating
                   birds at the more disturbed site had greater nest
                   attentiveness. They achieved this through
                   habituation, allowing a closer human approach before
                   leaving the nest, and returning to the nest faster
                   after a disturbance event. Despite lower average
                   daytime nest attentiveness at the more disturbed
                   site, incubation temperatures did not differ
                   significantly between sites. Nest mortality, mostly
                   by natural mammalian and corvid predators, was
                   significantly lower at the site experiencing high
                   recreational activity. However, chick mortality was
                   significantly greater at the more disturbed site,
                   most likely because of predation by domestic dogs.
                   Chick mortality may have been increased by the
                   habitation of chicks, whose escape responses were
                   much reduced at the more disturbed site. Nonetheless,
                   annual fecundity was substantially higher at the more
                   disturbed site, showing that the overall reproductive
                   fitness of wild birds is not always compromised by
                   human disturbance and urbanization. {\textcopyright}

                   benefit from utilizing a simple learning rule to
                   update estimates of temporal changes in resource
                   levels. In the model, initial expectation of resource
                   conditions and rate of replacing past information by
                   new experiences are genetically inherited traits.
                   Patch-time allocation differs between learners and
                   foragers that use a fixed patch-leaving threshold
                   throughout the foraging season. It also deviates from
                   foragers that obtain information about the
                   environment at no cost. At the start of a foraging
                   season, learners sample the environment by frequent
                   movements between patches, sacrificing current
                   resource intake for information acquisition. This is
                   done to obtain more precise and accurate estimates of
                   resource levels, resulting in increased intake rates
                   later in season. Risk of mortality may alter the
                   trade-off between exploration and exploitation and
                   thus change patch sampling effort. As lifetime
                   expectancy decreases, learners invest less in
                   information acquisition and show lower foraging
                   performance when resource level changes through time.

                   retention of neuronal representations of new
                   information, are ubiquitous among insects. Recent
                   research indicates that a variety of insects rely
                   extensively on learning for all major life activities
                   including feeding, predator avoidance, aggression,
                   social interactions, and sexual behavior. There is
                   good evidence that individuals within an insect
                   species exhibit genetically based variation in
                   learning abilities and indirect evidence linking
                   insect learning to fitness. Although insects rely on
                   innate behavior to successfully manage many types of
                   variation and unpredictability, learning may be
                   superior to innate behavior when dealing with
                   features unique to time, place, or individuals. Among
                   insects, social learning, which can promote the rapid
                   spread of novel behaviors, is currently known only
                   from a few well-studied examples in social
                   Hymenoptera. The prevalence and importance of social
                   learning in insects are still unknown. Similarly, we
                   know little about ecological factors that may have
                   promoted enhanced learning abilities in insects, and
                   whether learning has significantly contributed to

                   influencing the strength of density dependence in
                   natural populations still is limited. Consequently,
                   few general hypotheses have been advanced to explain
                   the large differences between species in the
                   magnitude of population fluctuations. One reason for
                   this is that the detection of density regulation in
                   population time series is complicated by time lags
                   induced by the life history of species that make it
                   difficult to separate the relative contributions of
                   intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the population
                   dynamics. Here we use population time series for 23
                   bird species to estimate parameters of a stochastic

                   that have a reduced variance in fitness can invade a
                   population consisting of individuals that on average
                   do better. Such strategies 'hedge their evolutionary
                   bets' against the variability of the environment. The
                   idea of bet-hedging arises from the fact that
                   appropriate measure of long-term fitness is sensitive
                   to variance, leading to the potential for strategies
                   with a reduced mean fitness to invade and increase in
                   frequency. Our aim is to review the conceptual
                   foundation of bet-hedging as a mechanism that
                   influences short- and long-term evolutionary
                   processes. We do so by presenting a general model
                   showing how evolutionary changes are affected by
                   variance in fitness and how genotypic variance in
                   fitness can be separated into variance in fitness at
                   the level of the individuals and correlations in
                   fitness among them. By breaking down genotypic
                   fitness variance in this way the traditional
                   divisions between conservative and diversified
                   strategies are more easily intuited, and it is also
                   shown that this division can be considered a false
                   dichotomy, and is better viewed as two extreme points
                   on a continuum. The model also sheds light on the
                   ideas of within- and between-generation bet-hedging,
                   which can also be generalized to be seen as two ends
                   of a different continuum. We use a simple example to
                   illustrate the virtues of our general model, as well
                   as discuss the implications for systems where
                   bet-hedging has been invoked as an explanation.},

                   relative strength of selection pressures on
                   adaptations to different habitats. Here I consider a
                   coarse-grained environment consisting of two habitat
                   types and investigate how the selection pressure on
                   reproductive success in different habitats depends on
                   their quality and frequency and the dispersal
                   pattern. The results suggest that selection on
                   adaptations to optimal habitats will usually be
                   stronger than on adaptations to poor habitats and the
                   ecological niche will thus tend to be an
                   evolutionarily conservative character. It is because
                   under the habitat choice or limited dispersal that
                   seem to prevail in natural populations, more
                   individuals encounter the better habitat than would
                   be expected solely on the basis of its relative area.
                   This bias results in reduced selection pressure on
                   reproductive success in the poorer habitat. With
                   habitat choice or limited dispersal, selection
                   pressure on reproductive success in the poorer
                   habitat may exceed that on reproductive success in
                   the better habitat only if the poorer habitat is much
                   more frequent in the environment than the better
                   habitat and the difference in their quality is not

                   models indicate that metapopulation growth rate is
                   usually more sensitive to the vital rates of
                   individuals in high-quality (i.e., good) patches than
                   in lowquality (i.e., bad) patches. This suggests
                   that, given a choice, management efforts should focus
                   on good rather than bad patches. Here, we examine the
                   sensitivity of metapopulation growth rate for a
                   two-patch matrix metapopulation model with and
                   without stochastic disturbance and found cases where
                   managers can more efficiently increase metapopulation
                   growth rate by focusing efforts on the bad patch. In
                   our model, net reproductive rate differs between the
                   two patches so that in the absence of dispersal, one
                   patch is high quality and the other low quality.
                   Disturbance, when present, reduces net reproductive
                   rate with equal frequency and intensity in both
                   patches. The stochastic disturbance model gives
                   qualitatively similar results to the deterministic
                   model. In most cases, metapopulation growth rate was
                   elastic to changes in net reproductive rate of
                   individuals in the good patch than the bad patch.
                   However, when the majority of individuals are located
                   in the bad patch, metapopulation growth rate can be
                   most elastic to net reproductive rate in the bad
                   patch. We expand the model to include two stages and
                   parameterize the patches using data for the softshell
                   clam, Mya arenaria. With a two-stage demographic
                   model, the elasticities of metapopulation growth rate
                   to parameters in the bad patch increase, while
                   elasticities to the same parameters in the good patch
                   decrease. Metapopulation growth rate is most elastic
                   to adult survival in the population of the good patch
                   for all scenarios we examine. If the majority of the
                   metapopulation is located in the bad patch, the
                   elasticity to parameters of that population increase
                   but do not surpass elasticity to parameters in the
                   good patch. This model can be expanded to include
                   additional patches,multiple stages, stochastic
                   dispersal, and complex demography.},

  abstract =      {For most species, a changeable environment creates a
                   situation in which recruitment varies considerably
                   from one breeding season to the next. If adults
                   survive well, an occasional favorable recruitment can
                   sustain population numbers over long periods. In
                   effect, the gains made in favorable periods are
                   stored in the adult population. Storage is
                   particularly important when the species is at low
                   densities, because then the potential population
                   growth rate is very high if a favorable period
                   occurs. Our past work showed that the storage
                   mechanism could lead to coexistence of two species in
                   lottery competition for space, as long as generations
                   overlapped and there was sufficient variation in
                   recruitment (Chesson and Warner 1981). This was true
                   even if one species had an average competitive
                   advantage. The storage model also operates when more
                   than two species are competing, when resources renew
                   independently of population sizes, and when not all
                   the resource is used. It also operates in simple
                   Lotka-Volterra systems in which adults do not compete
                   directly with juveniles. The field ecologist is faced
                   with the more practical problem of determining
                   whether the storage mechanism is operating in a
                   particular system. Species with relatively long lives
                   and high fecundities are most likely to enjoy the
                   benefits of the storage effect. Environments that
                   theoretically elicit these life history
                   characteristics are relatively benign and permanent
                   for established adults, but are such that births
                   and/or juvenile survivorship vary widely. Trees and
                   many marine organisms are examples of species with
                   the proper life histories, and storage may be
                   important in maintaining the high diversity of these
                   communities. The storage mechanism is capable of
                   independently maintaining species coexistence, and we
                   provide some suggestions on how to distinguish
                   qualitatively the operation of storage from
                   alternative mechanisms. We expect, however, that
                   storage will make some positive contribution toward
                   species persistence in nearly all communities, and we
                   give a method for estimating empirically how large
                   that contribution is. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169;

                   distributed resources may use experiences in previous
                   patches to learn the habitat quality and adjust their
                   behavior. We map the ecological landscape for the
                   evolution of learning under a range of conditions,
                   including both spatial and temporal heteroge-neity.
                   We compare the learning strategy with genetically
                   fixed patch-leaving rules and with strategies of
                   foragers that have free and perfect information about
                   their environment. The model reveals that the
                   efficiency of learning is highest when low encounter
                   stochasticity results in reliable estimates of patch
                   quality, when there is no or little temporal change,
                   and when there is little spatial variability. This
                   partially contrasts with the value of learning, which
                   is highest when there is temporal change, because
                   flexible strategies may track the environmental
                   trend, and when there is spatial variability, because
                   there is a need to distinguish between good and bad
                   patches. Learning rules with short-term memory are
                   beneficial when patch information is accurate and
                   when there is temporal change, whereas learning rules
                   that update slowly are generally more robust to
                   spatial variability. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The

                   establishes and persists. Recently, how- ever, it has
                   been suggested that, in cases where the data are
                   sourced from historical records of purposefully
                   released species, the direction of causality is
                   reversed, and that initial success leads to higher

                   implications of this alternative hypothesis, and
                   derive six a priori predic- tions from it. We test

                   study reaffirms that the conventional paradigm in

                   impoverishment of biodiversity, yet the underlying
                   reasons remain poorly understood. The classical
                   explanation is that organisms differ in tolerance to
                   urbanization, but current supporting evidence is
                   insufficient because of the difficulties of
                   quantifying such tolerance accurately in comparative
                   studies. However, with information on the abundance
                   of species along urbanization gradients, it is
                   possible to construct simple urbanization tolerance
                   indices that account for the fact that the density of
                   a species in an urbanised environment depends in part
                   on its density in the surrounding natural

  abstract =      {Summary: Generalist species are more successful than
                   specialists in anthropogenically modified
                   environments or in environments in which they have
                   been introduced, but the nature of the link between
                   generalism and establishment success is unclear. A
                   higher feeding innovation rate has previously been
                   reported in habitat generalist birds from North
                   America. By allowing them to exploit new resources,
                   this higher feeding innovation rate might explain the
                   generalists' advantage. This result might be due to
                   generalists being more likely to find new resources
                   because they are exposed to more diverse
                   environmental conditions. Alternatively, they might
                   differ from specialists in other traits, in
                   particular cognitive skills that might allow them to
                   innovate more complex food searching and handling
                   techniques. To test these hypotheses, we separated
                   avian feeding innovations into a 'technical' (novel
                   searching and handling behaviour) and a 'food type'
                   (incorporation of a new food in a species' diet)
                   category. Technical innovations, but not food type
                   innovations, have previously been shown to correlate
                   with avian brain size, suggesting they reflect
                   cognitive ability. We used a world-wide data base of
                   2339 feeding innovations recorded in the literature,
                   covering a total of 765 avian species and assessed
                   the correlations between brain size and feeding
                   innovation rates on one side and habitat and diet
                   generalism on the other. Habitat generalism was
                   positively related with food type innovation rate,
                   but not technical innovation rate or brain size. This
                   suggests that habitat generalist species are more
                   likely to incorporate new food types in their diet
                   because of higher chances to find new food resources
                   in their environment, or of a higher opportunism, but
                   not enhanced cognitive skills. In contrast, diet
                   generalist species had higher food type and technical
                   innovation rates, as well as larger brains,
                   suggesting that cognitive skills might help species
                   expand their diet breadth or that an increase in diet
                   breadth might favour the evolution of enhanced
                   cognitive abilities. Our results provide new insights
                   into the nature of the generalists' advantage in the
                   face of environmental changes, and suggest that
                   dietary and habitat generalism are different, but
                   convergent, routes to feeding flexibility and
                   adaptation to changed environments.},

                   flexibility can help reconcile apparently contrasting

                   Barriers to success are expected to filter spe- cies
                   at each stage along the invasion pathway. No study to
                   date, however, has investigated how species traits
                   associate with success from introduction to spread at
                   a large spatial scale in any group. Using the largest
                   data set of mammalian introductions at the global
                   scale and recently developed phylogenetic comparative
                   methods, we show that human-mediated introductions
                   con- siderably bias which species have the
                   opportunity to become invasive, as highly productive
                   mam- mals with longer reproductive lifespans are far
                   more likely to be introduced. Subsequently, greater
                   reproductive output and higher introduction effort

                   determining extinction risks of small populations,
                   but it is largely unknown how its effect depends on
                   the life histories of species. We modeled effects of
                   demographic stochasticity on extinction risk in a
                   broad range of generalized life histories, using
                   matrix models and branching processes. Extinction
                   risks of life histories varied greatly in their
                   sensitivity to demographic stochasticity. Comparing
                   life histories, extinction risk generally increased
                   with increasing fecundity and decreased with higher
                   ages of maturation. Effects of adult survival
                   depended on age of maturation. At lower ages of
                   maturation, extinction risk peaked at intermediate
                   levels of adult survival, but it increased along with
                   adult survival at higher ages of maturation. These
                   differences were largely explained by differences in
                   sensitivities of population growth to perturbations

                   factors that explain variation in reproductive
                   success, i.e. in the number of offspring produced. In
                   altricial birds, a substantial part of this variation
                   is determined by the number of nestlings that die
                   before fledging, but surprisingly little is known
                   about the proximate causes of offspring mortality
                   during the nestling period. We used a uniquely
                   comprehensive dataset of parental nestbox visits from
                   seven breeding seasons to investigate the association
                   between parental behaviour and nestling mortality in
                   a population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). In
                   almost all nests that suffered complete brood
                   mortality one of the parents had suddenly disappeared
                   during the nestling stage. In contrast, parental
                   disappearance in nests with partial brood mortality
                   was rare and equally common as in nests with no brood
                   loss. With few exceptions, parents that disappeared
                   during the nestling stage were never observed again
                   and never returned to breed. In contrast, parents
                   that remained after their partner disappeared were
                   equally likely to be observed again or return to
                   breed as parents of nests where both parents stayed.
                   Visit rates at nests where a parent would disappear
                   did not differ from those at nests where both parents
                   stayed. Taken together, our results show that - in
                   contrast to partial brood failure - complete brood
                   failure is almost always associated with the sudden
                   and permanent disappearance of one of the parents,
                   probably due to predation. Partial and complete brood
                   mortality should be treated as distinct processes
                   that have different underlying causes.},

                   environmental and eco- nomic costs. In order to
                   prevent invasions and target monitoring efforts most
                   effectively, we need to forecast locations at the
                   greatest risk of new invasions. To accomplish this,
                   we need to estimate propagule pressure (inoculum
                   size) and consider population processes, including
                   possible Allee effects. Here, we develop a method to
                   estimate the probability of population establishment,
                   based on survival analysis and maximum likelihood
                   techniques. We demonstrate theoretically the validity
                   of this approach, considering environmental het-
                   erogeneity, estimation error, and nonlinearity. We
                   then apply this method to zebra mussel (Dreissena
                   polymorpha) invasions of Michigan inland lakes. We
                   fit our model using pres- ence/absence data for 1589
                   lakes between 1992 and 1996 and propagule pressure
                   estimates from gravity models of boater traffic.
                   Using our fitted model, we estimated the
                   probabilities of establishment and demonstrated that
                   Allee effects were present in the zebra mussel
                   system. We validated our model using invasion data
                   from 1997–2001 (data not used to parameterize the
                   model). For the validation time period, we correctly
                   predicted up to nine times as many invasions as a
                   null (random) model. Further, the Allee model
                   assigned average probabilities of invasion four times
                   higher for lakes that became invaded than for
                   uninvaded lakes, whereas the non-Allee model
                   predicted probabilities for invaded lakes only two
                   times higher. Thus, our model demonstrates the
                   importance of considering the Allee effect and

                   predictive models for life-history evolution. It
                   helped to galvanize the empirical field of
                   comparative life-history and dominated thinking on
                   the subject from the late 1960s through the 1970s.
                   Large quantities of field data were collected that
                   claimed to test predictions of the theory. By the
                   early 1980s, sentiment about the theory had changed
                   so completely that a proposal to test it or the use
                   of it to interpret empirical results would likely be
                   viewed as archaic and naive. The theory was
                   displaced,by demographic models that concentrated on
                   mortality patterns as the cause of life-history
                   evolution. Although demographic models are known for
                   their density-independent approach and focus on
                   extrinsic mortality, these models can incorporate
                   many ecological features captured by r- and
                   K-selection, such as density-dependent population
                   regulation, resource availability, and environmental
                   fluctuations. We highlight the incorporation of these
                   factors in recent theory, then show how they are
                   manifest in our research on life-history evolution in
                   Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata).
                   Explanations of the repeatable suites of life-history
                   differences across populations of guppies originate
                   from demographic models of predator-driven
                   age-specific mortality. Recently, careful examination
                   of guppy demography and habitat has revealed that
                   density-dependent regulation and resource
                   availability may have influenced the evolution of
                   guppy life histories. In the field, these factors
                   covary with predation risk; however, they can be
                   uncoupled experimentally, providing insight into how
                   they may have synergistically driven guppy
                   life-history evolution. Although life-history theory
                   has shifted away from a focus on r- and K-selection,
                   the themes of density-dependent regulation, resource
                   availability, and environmental fluctuations are
                   integral to current demographic theory and are
                   potentially important in any natural system.},

                   constant throughout an individual's lifetime. It
                   might also mitigate senescence, as the mismatch
                   between the environment and a non-plastic
                   individual's traits is likely to increase as time
                   passes. To understand why reversible plasticity may
                   covary with lifespan, studies tend to assume
                   unidirectional causality: plasticity evolves under
                   suitable rates of environmental variation with
                   respect to life history. Here we show that if
                   lifespan also evolves in response to plasticity, then
                   long life is not merely a context that sets the stage
                   for lifelong plasticity. Instead, the causality is
                   bidirectional because plasticity itself can select
                   for longevity. Highly autocorrelated environmental
                   fluctuations predict low investment in reversible
                   plasticity and a phenotype that is poorly matched to
                   the environment at older ages. Such environments
                   select for high reproductive effort and short

                   methods or viewpoints. Some workers have approached
                   ecological problems from a theoretical, mathematical
                   standpoint; others have been decidedly pragmatic and
                   empirical. A few have even proven able to reconcile
                   these often divergent approaches within the scope of
                   some particularly masterful study. Yet, for all the
                   diversity in the approaches to the major problems of
                   ecology, there has been a striking neglect of
                   psychological factors that control or regulate the
                   behavior of animals. This bald assertion is not
                   intended to minimize the frequency, importance, or
                   value of specific behavioral studies which seek to
                   explain habitat selection, food preferences, or the
                   like. What is lacking is a more general account of
                   the relation between the principles and facts studied
                   by psychologists and those of interest to ecologists.
                   In this short book, we hope to summarize what we
                   consider to be the major problems of ecology and to
                   suggest how the application of psychological
                   viewpoints can contribute to our understanding of
                   them. Our approach is frankly speculative, for the
                   present need seems to be for a suggestion of the
                   nature of the rapprochement of ecology and psychology
                   rather than for an exhaustive review of the areas of
                   overlap. What, then, are the ecologist's fundamental
                   problems? These have traditionally dealt with the
                   manner in which a finite amount of space and energy
                   is distributed among species, as well as with a
                   temporal dimension of this distribution. We may
                   restate these problems colloquially: 1. Why don't
                   predators overeat their prey? 2. How are space and
                   food shared? 3. Why are there so many species? 4. How
                   do species remain distinct? These seemingly simple
                   queries, as a moment's reflection will show, require
                   a consideration of competition, trophic levels and
                   energy exchange, community stability, niche
                   diversification, speciation, and those related topics
                   which comprise the entire field of ecology. By
                   casting our questions in this particular form, the
                   strictly behavioral problems in ecology can be best
                   outlined.},

                   for evolutionary shifts in thermal physiology with
                   altitude. Because behavioral adjustments are commonly
                   used by ectotherms to regulate physiological
                   performance, regulatory behaviors should generally
                   constrain rather than drive evolution, a phenomenon
                   we call the "Bogert effect." We briefly review a few
                   other examples that contradict the classical view of
                   behavior as the inevitable driving force in
                   evolution. Overall, our analysis and brief review
                   challenge the classical view that behavior is
                   invariably the driving force in evolution, and
                   instead our work supports the alternative view that
                   behavior has diverse - and sometimes conflicting -
                   effects on the directions and rates at which other
                   traits evolve.},

  abstract =      {Models of population divergence and speciation are
                   often based on the assumption that differences
                   between populations are due to genetic factors, and
                   that phenotypic change is due to natural selection.
                   It is equally plausible that some of the differences
                   among populations are due to phenotypic plasticity.
                   We use the metaphor of the adaptive landscape to
                   review the role of phenotypic plasticity in driving
                   genetic evolution. Moderate levels of phenotypic
                   plasticity are optimal in permitting population
                   survival in a new environment and in bringing
                   populations into the realm of attraction of an
                   adaptive peak. High levels of plasticity may increase
                   the probability of population persistence but reduce
                   the likelihood of genetic change, because the plastic
                   response itself places the population close to a
                   peak. Moderate levels of plasticity arise whenever
                   multiple traits, some of which are plastic and others
                   not, form a composite trait involved in the adaptive
                   response. For example, altered behaviours may drive
                   selection on morphology and physiology. Because there
                   is likely to be a considerable element of chance in
                   which behaviours become established, behavioural
                   change followed by morphological and physiological
                   evolution may be a potent force in driving evolution
                   in novel directions. We assess the role of phenotypic
                   plasticity in stimulating evolution by considering
                   two examples from birds: (i) the evolution of red and
                   yellow plumage coloration due to carotenoid
                   consumption; and (ii) the evolution of foraging
                   behaviours on islands. Phenotypic plasticity is
                   widespread in nature and may speed up, slow down, or
                   have little effect on evolutionary change. Moderate
                   levels of plasticity may often facilitate genetic
                   evolution but careful analyses of individual cases
                   are needed to ascertain whether plasticity has been
                   essential or merely incidental to population
                   differentiation.},

                   improve predictions of climate-driven range shifts.
                   However, the usefulness of traits is usually assumed
                   rather than quantified. Here, we present a framework
                   to identify the most informative traits, based on
                   four key range-shift processes: emigration of
                   individuals or propagules away from the natal
                   location; the distance a species can move;
                   establishment of self-sustaining populations; and
                   proliferation following establishment. We propose a
                   framework that categorises traits according to their
                   contribution to range-shift processes. We demonstrate
                   how the framework enables the predictive value of
                   traits to be evaluated empirically and how this
                   categorisation can be used to better understand
                   range-shift processes; we also illustrate how
                   range-shift estimates can be improved. The ecological
                   traits of species are increasingly used to inform
                   predictions of climate-driven range shifts. Traits
                   utilised should correspond to range-shift processes:
                   emigration, movement, establishment, and
                   proliferation. We categorise traits according to the
                   information that they offer for each process.The most
                   informative traits can be informed by biogeographical
                   and demographic evidence bases: species range sizes,
                   range filling, recent range shifts, population
                   fluctuations, and success following
                   naturalisation.Movement traits are often used in
                   range-shift studies, although their importance is not
                   universally supported. Ecological generalisation,
                   persistence in unfavourable conditions, reproductive
                   strategy, and intraspecific competitive ability
                   should be considered for inclusion in range-shift

                   overcome the diverse suite of new selection pressures
                   is a fundamental question in ecology and evolution.
                   Urban environments differ markedly from the rural
                   ones that they replace and successful colonisation of
                   urban areas may therefore require local adaptation
                   and phenotypic/genetic divergence from ancestral
                   populations. Such a process would be facilitated by
                   limited dispersal to and from the novel habitat. Here
                   we assess divergence in migratory behaviour between
                   seven pairs of urban and rural European blackbird
                   Turdus merula populations along a 2800 km transect
                   across Europe. This former forest specialist is now
                   amongst the most abundant urban birds across most of
                   its range. We use a stable isotope approach due to
                   the lack of sufficient ringing data from multiple
                   urban populations, and compare hydrogen isotopic
                   ratios of tissues grown in the breeding (feathers)
                   and wintering areas (claws) to derive an index of
                   long distance migratory behaviour. We find a tendency
                   for urban blackbirds to be more sedentary than rural
                   ones at all sites and this divergence is particularly
                   strong at the north-eastern limit of our transect,
                   i.e. in Estonia and Latvia. These urban populations
                   are those that have been established most recently
                   (from the late 1930s to 1950s) implying that
                   urbanisation can promote rapid ecological divergence.
                   The increased sedentary behaviour of urban birds
                   could promote further ecological divergence between
                   rural and urban populations, such as the earlier
                   breeding of urban blackbirds, and in some cases may
                   contribute to their previously documented genetic
                   divergence. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors. Oikos

                   challenge for wildlife. Nevertheless, a few species
                   appear to thrive in the evolutionarily novel
                   environment created by cities, demonstrating the
                   remarkable adaptability of some animals. We argue
                   that individuals that can adjust their behaviours to
                   the new selection pressures presented by cities
                   should have greater success in urban habitats.
                   Accordingly, urban wildlife often exhibit behaviours
                   that differ from those of their rural counterparts,
                   from changes to food and den preferences to
                   adjustments in the structure of their signals.
                   Research suggests that behavioural flexibility (or
                   phenotypic plasticity) may be an important
                   characteristic for succeeding in urban environments.
                   Moreover, some individuals or species might possess
                   behavioural traits (a particular temperament) that
                   are inherently well suited to occupying urban
                   habitats, such as a high level of disturbance
                   tolerance. This suggests that members of species that
                   are less 'plastic' or naturally timid in temperament
                   are likely to be disadvantaged in high-disturbance

  abstract =      {Recent studies suggest that populations and species
                   often exhibit behavioral syndromes; that is, suites
                   of correlated behaviors across situations. An example
                   is an aggression syndrome where some individuals are
                   more aggressive, whereas others are less aggressive
                   across a range of situations and contexts. The
                   existence of behavioral syndromes focuses the
                   attention of behavioral ecologists on limited (less
                   than optimal) behavioral plasticity and behavioral
                   carryovers across situations, rather than on optimal
                   plasticity in each isolated situation. Behavioral
                   syndromes can explain behaviors that appear
                   strikingly non-adaptive in an isolated context (e.g.
                   inappropriately high activity when predators are
                   present, or excessive sexual cannibalism). Behavioral
                   syndromes can also help to explain the maintenance of
                   individual variation in behavioral types, a
                   phenomenon that is ubiquitous, but often ignored.
                   Recent studies suggest that the behavioral type of an
                   individual, population or species can have important
                   ecological and evolutionary implications, including
                   major effects on species distributions, on the
                   relative tendencies of species to be invasive or to
                   respond well to environmental change, and on
                   speciation rates. Although most studies of behavioral
                   syndromes to date have focused on a few organisms,
                   mainly in the laboratory, further work on other
                   species, particularly in the field, should yield

                   behavioural differences are repeatable over time and
                   across situations. This common phenomenon covers
                   numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of
                   novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and
                   sociality. The study of temperament is central to
                   animal psychology, behavioural genetics,
                   pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively
                   few studies have examined the ecology and evolution
                   of temperament traits. This situation is surprising,
                   given that temperament is likely to exert an
                   important influence on many aspects of animal ecology
                   and evolution, and that individual variation in
                   temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal
                   species. Possible explanations for this neglect of
                   temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an
                   insufficient understanding of the link between
                   temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of
                   coherence in terminology with similar traits often
                   given different names, or different traits given the
                   same name. We propose that temperament can and should
                   be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework
                   and provide a terminology that could be used as a
                   working tool for ecological studies of temperament.
                   Our terminology includes five major temperament trait
                   categories: shyness-boldness, exploration-avoidance,
                   activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This
                   terminology does not make inferences regarding
                   underlying dispositions or psychological processes,
                   which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary
                   biologists from working on these traits. We present
                   extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that
                   temperament traits are heritable, and linked to
                   fitness and to several other traits of importance to
                   ecology and evolution. Furthermore, we describe
                   ecologically relevant measurement methods and point
                   to several ecological and evolutionary topics that
                   would benefit from considering temperament, such as
                   phenotypic plasticity, conservation biology,
                   population sampling, and invasion biology.},

                   life. The juveniles differed consistently in their
                   reaction to a novel object in a familiar environment,
                   either when tested with different objects or when
                   tested again after 9 weeks. Birds that approached a
                   novel object more quickly were also quicker to visit
                   all artificial trees present in a novel environment
                   than birds that approached a novel object more
                   slowly. These behavioural differences extended to the
                   strength of foraging habits, built up during a
                   training period in which food was always offered at
                   the same place. After a change in the location of
                   food, the quicker birds would keep going to the place
                   where the food used to be. The slower birds tended to
                   change their behaviour and stop going to the former
                   place. The results show that juvenile male great tits
                   differ consistently in various aspects of their
                   exploratory behaviour at least during the first 18
                   weeks of life. The variation in behaviour was not
                   likely to arise from differences in general activity
                   or physical condition, but seems to refer to
                   differences in the way in which information
                   concerning the environment is collected and dealt
                   with. {\textcopyright} 1994 The Association for the

                   novelty responses and the probability that an
                   innovation will arise in foraging birds. This chapter
                   reveals that for foraging adult birds, neophobia is
                   the most apparent response to novelty. Although
                   neophobia is a widespread, if not universal response,
                   of adult birds, the intensity of expression varies
                   considerably between individuals within a species and
                   between closely related species. It further
                   elaborates the two hypotheses that account for
                   adaptive variation in neophobia: the neophobia
                   threshold hypothesis (NTH) and the dangerous niche
                   hypothesis (DNH). This chapter states that
                   uninhibited neophilia is commonly expressed in
                   juvenile birds, particularly passerines. The nexus of
                   neophilia, object play, and a high degree of motor
                   plasticity in juveniles make this life history stage
                   an important one to examine for the origins of
                   innovative behaviour. This chapter conclusively
                   states that it is likely that neophilia and neophobia
                   can function simultaneously in adult birds, and that
                   initial neophobia masks any attraction to novelty.},

                   conceptual foundation for our understanding of
                   ecological patterns and dynamics. In particular,
                   ecologists recognise the important role that animal
                   behaviour plays in shaping ecological processes. An
                   emerging area of interest in animal behaviour, the
                   study of behavioural syndromes (animal personalities)
                   considers how limited behavioural plasticity, as well
                   as behavioural correlations affects an individual's
                   fitness in diverse ecological contexts. In this
                   article we explore how insights from the concept and
                   study of behavioural syndromes provide fresh
                   understanding of major issues in population ecology.
                   We identify several general mechanisms for how
                   population ecology phenomena can be influenced by a
                   species or population's average behavioural type, by
                   within-species variation in behavioural type, or by
                   behavioural correlations across time or across
                   ecological contexts. We note, in particular, the
                   importance of behavioural type-dependent dispersal in
                   spatial ecology. We then review recent literature and
                   provide new syntheses for how these general
                   mechanisms produce novel insights on five major
                   issues in population ecology: (1) limits to species'
                   distribution and abundance; (2) species interactions;
                   (3) population dynamics; (4) relative responses to
                   human-induced rapid environmental change; and (5)

  abstract =      {In recent years evidence has been accumulating that
                   personalities are not only found in humans but also
                   in a wide range of other animal species. Individuals
                   differ consistently in their behavioural tendencies
                   and the behaviour in one context is correlated with
                   the behaviour in multiple other contexts. From an
                   adaptive perspective, the evolution of animal
                   personalities is still a mystery, because a more
                   flexible structure of behaviour should provide a
                   selective advantage. Accordingly, many researchers
                   view personalities as resulting from constraints
                   imposed by the architecture of behaviour (but see
                   ref. 12). In contrast, we show here that animal
                   personalities can be given an adaptive explanation.
                   Our argument is based on the insight that the
                   trade-off between current and future reproduction
                   often results in polymorphic populations in which
                   some individuals put more emphasis on future fitness
                   returns than others. Life-history theory predicts
                   that such differences in fitness expectations should
                   result in systematic differences in risk-taking
                   behaviour. Individuals with high future expectations
                   (who have much to lose) should be more risk-averse
                   than individuals with low expectations. This applies
                   to all kinds of risky situations, so individuals
                   should consistently differ in their behaviour. By
                   means of an evolutionary model we demonstrate that
                   this basic principle results in the evolution of
                   animal personalities. It simultaneously explains the
                   coexistence of behavioural types, the consistency of
                   behaviour through time and the structure of
                   behavioural correlations across contexts. Moreover,
                   it explains the common finding that explorative
                   behaviour and risk-related traits like boldness and
                   aggressiveness are common characteristics of animal
                   personalities.},

                   tropical bird species and among individuals of the

                   insights into functional connections between life
                   history and physiology. To assess constitutive innate
                   immunity we introduced a new technique in the field
                   of ecological and evolutionary immunology that
                   quantifies the bactericidal activity of whole blood.
                   This in vitro assay utilises a single blood sample to
                   provide a functional, integrated measure of
                   constitutive innate immunity. We found that the
                   bactericidal activity of whole blood varied
                   considerably among species and among individuals
                   within a species. This variation was not correlated
                   with body mass or whole-organism BMR. However, among
                   species, bacteria killing activity was negatively
                   correlated with mass-adjusted BMR, suggesting that
                   species with a slower pace-of-life have evolved a
                   more robust constitutive innate immune capability.
                   Among individuals of a single species, the house
                   wren, bacteria killing activity was positively
                   correlated with mass-adjusted BMR, pointing to
                   physiological differences in individual quality on
                   which natural selection potentially could act.

                   vertebrates, but circulating concentrations can vary
                   dramatically among species. We examined the
                   hypothesis that variation in titres of corticosterone
                   (Cort) and testosterone (T) is related to
                   life-history traits of avian species. We predicted
                   that Cort would reach higher levels under stress in
                   species with higher annual adult survival rates since
                   Cort is thought to promote physiological and
                   behavioural responses that reduce risk to the
                   individual. Conversely, we predicted that peak T
                   during the breeding season would be higher in
                   short-lived species with high mating effort as this
                   hormone is known to promote male fecundity traits. We
                   quantified circulating hormone concentrations and key
                   life-history traits (annual adult survival rate,
                   breeding season length, body mass) in males of
                   free-living bird species during the breeding season
                   at a temperate site (northern USA) and a tropical
                   site (central Panama). We analysed our original data
                   by themselves, and also combined with published data
                   on passerine birds to enhance sample size. In both
                   approaches, variation in baseline Cort (Cort0) among
                   species was inversely related to breeding season
                   length and body mass. Stress-induced corticosterone
                   (MaxCort) also varied inversely with body mass and,
                   as predicted, also varied positively with annual
                   adult survival rates. Furthermore, species from drier
                   and colder environments exhibited lower MaxCort than
                   mesic and tropical species; T was lowest in species
                   from tropical environments. These findings suggest
                   that Cort0, MaxCort and T modulate key vertebrate
                   life-history responses to the environment, with Cort0
                   supporting energetically demanding processes, MaxCort
                   promoting survival and T being related to mating

                   approached by a potential predator provide
                   information about the risk that individuals are
                   willing to take given their state and the
                   environment. Species differ in mean and variance in
                   FID, suggesting that species with a large variance in
                   FID have individuals that take either small or great
                   risks, whereas species with a small variance are
                   composed of individuals that are homogeneous in their
                   risk-taking behavior. Here, we investigate the
                   correlations between interspecific variance in
                   risk-taking behavior and habitat selection, breeding
                   range and population size, dispersal, and life
                   history. Greater between individual variation in
                   risk-taking behavior for a given average level of
                   risk taking would imply that more different habitats
                   could be exploited, resulting in larger local and
                   global population sizes and larger ranges. There
                   should be a link between dispersal distances and FID
                   because individuals of risk-averse species should
                   encounter greater difficulties of finding suitable
                   breeding habitats. High local and global population
                   sizes should select for fast life histories with
                   early age at first reproduction, high annual
                   fecundity, low juvenile survival, and fast rates of
                   senescence in species with variable FIDs. Finally, a
                   greater diversity of habitat use should select for a
                   longer reproductive season in species with more
                   variable FIDs. Analyses of FIDs for 133 species of
                   birds revealed results largely consistent with these
                   predictions. Because risk taking correlates with
                   other kinds of behavior that constitute a syndrome
                   behavioral syndromes can play an important role in
                   producing ecological syndromes (i.e., correlations

  abstract =      {The life history of tropical birds differs from that
                   of their temperate counterparts by late start of
                   reproduction, small clutch sizes, and high rates of
                   adult survival. Thus, tropical species should have
                   greater residual reproductive value than temperate
                   species. Therefore, tropical birds can be predicted
                   to take smaller risks than closely related temperate
                   birds in order not to jeopardize their prospects of
                   survival, which is the single most important
                   component of fitness, and which is greater in
                   tropical than in temperate species. We estimated
                   flight distances as a measure of risk-taking behavior
                   of common species of birds for populations living in
                   tropical areas in China (mainly Hainan) and in
                   temperate Europe (mainly Denmark and France),
                   predicting that flight distances should be longer in
                   tropical than in temperate populations, and that the
                   difference in flight distance between these 2
                   environments should be positively correlated with the
                   difference in clutch size. Mean flight distance was
                   more than twice as large in tropical compared with
                   temperate populations for 25 pairs of taxa. The
                   difference in flight distance between tropical and
                   temperate taxa decreased with the difference in
                   clutch size between the 2 environments. These
                   findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
                   tropical birds take smaller risks than closely
                   related temperate taxa to minimize the risk of early
                   death due to predation. {\textcopyright} 2012 The

                   at maturity, and rate of reproduction, vary across
                   environments and in combinations imposed by
                   trade-offs and limitations of physiological
                   mechanisms. A plethora of studies have described the
                   diversity of traits and hypothesized selection
                   pressures shaping components of the
                   survival-reproduction trade-off. Life-history
                   variation appears to fall along a slow-fast
                   continuum, with slow pace characterized by higher
                   investment in survival over reproduction and fast
                   pace characterized by higher investment in
                   reproduction over survival. The Pace-of-Life Syndrome
                   (POLS) is a framework to describe the slow-fast axis
                   of variation in life-history traits and physiological
                   traits. The POLS corresponds to latitudinal
                   gradients, with tropical birds exhibiting a slow pace
                   of life. We examined four possible ways that the
                   traits of high-elevation birds might correspond to
                   the POLS continuum: (i) rapid pace, (ii) tropical
                   slow pace, (iii) novel elevational pace, or (iv)
                   constrained pace. Recent studies reveal that birds
                   breeding at high elevations in temperate zones
                   exhibit a combination of traits creating a unique
                   elevational pace of life with a central trade-off
                   similar to a slow pace but physiological trade-offs
                   more similar to a fast pace. A paucity of studies
                   prevents consideration of the possibility of a
                   constrained pace of life. We propose extending the
                   POLS framework to include trait variation of
                   elevational clines to help to investigate complexity
                   in global geographic patterns.},

                   the recently highlighted pace-of-life syndrome
                   hypothesis predicts the coevolution of behavioral,
                   physiological and life-history traits. For instance,
                   bolder and shyer individuals do not only differ in
                   personality profiles, but also in neuro-endocrinology
                   and breeding patterns. While theory predicts that
                   bolder (i.e., proactive), more aggressive individuals
                   should colonize more rapidly urbanized habitats than
                   shyer (i.e., reactive), less aggressive individuals,
                   it is also predicted that across generations,
                   adaptive selection processes could favor shyer
                   individuals that are more sensitive to novel
                   environmental cues. Here we compared two personality
                   traits (handling aggression, exploration score in a
                   novel environment), one physiological trait related
                   to stress response (breath rate) and four breeding
                   traits (lay date, clutch size, hatching success and
                   fledging success) in a rural and an urban study
                   population of Mediterranean great tits Parus major.
                   Mixed models revealed strong phenotypic divergence
                   between forest and city in most traits explored, in
                   particular in personality, whereby urban great tits
                   were more reactive to stress and faster explorers
                   compared to rural birds (yet not more aggressive).
                   Urban birds also laid smaller broods earlier in
                   spring compared to their rural conspecifics, and city
                   broods resulted in lower hatching success yet
                   interestingly fledging success was similar. Nest-box
                   centered measures of anthropogenic (artificial light,
                   pedestrians, and cars) perturbation and resource
                   abundance allowed us to go beyond the classical
                   forest/city comparison by exploring the phenotypic
                   variation across an urbanization gradient. This
                   revealed that high urbanization in nest-box
                   surroundings was associated overall with earlier
                   breeding and smaller clutches, but also with faster
                   breath rate, although these trends showed strong
                   annual variation. Ongoing rapid urbanization and
                   non-random gene flow between rural and urban great
                   tits could both contribute to the high prevalence of
                   bold breeders in the city. Our study suggests the
                   existence of urban and rural great tit ecotypes with
                   different pace-of-life, but also a finer-scale
                   divergence along the degree of urbanization within
                   the city. Future studies are required to determine
                   whether this phenotypic variation at different
                   spatiotemporal scales is adaptive and whether it has
                   a genetic basis or results from phenotypic
                   plasticity.},

                   differences in cognition remain relatively unstudied
                   in non-human animals. One intriguing possibility is
                   that variation in cognition is functionally related
                   to variation in personality. Here, we review some
                   examples and present hypotheses on relationships
                   between personality (or behavioural syndromes) and
                   individual differences in cognitive style. Our
                   hypotheses are based largely on a connection between
                   fast-slow behavioural types (BTs; e.g. boldness,
                   aggressiveness, exploration tendency) and cognitive
                   speed-accuracy trade-offs. We also discuss

                   important aspects of decision-making, including
                   sampling, impulsivity, risk sensitivity and

                   populations are near evolutionary equilibrium and

                   urbanization, using a data set of flight distances of
                   44 common species of European birds in different
                   stages of adaptation to urban environments. Urban
                   populations had consistently shorter flight distances
                   than rural populations of the same species. Variation
                   in relative flight distance of urban populations was
                   predicted by the number of generations since

                   indication of local adaptation to urban environments.
                   Relative flight distance of urban population was

  abstract =      {Background: Urbanization is the most prevailing cause
                   of habitat transformation worldwide, differing from
                   others by its intense levels of human activity.
                   Despite its obvious impact on wildlife, it is still
                   unclear why and how some species are able to adapt to
                   urban settings. One possibility is that fear of
                   humans and vehicles could preclude most species from
                   invading cities. Species entering urban environments
                   might be those that are more tolerant of human
                   disturbance (i.e., tame species). Alternatively or in
                   addition, urban invaders could be a fraction of
                   variable species, with "tame" individuals invading
                   urban habitats and other individuals remaining in
                   rural areas. Methodology: Using the contemporary
                   urban invasion by birds in a recently established
                   South American city, we tested both hypotheses by
                   relating interspecific differences in invasiveness to
                   their flight initiation distances (i.e., the
                   distances at which birds flee from approaching cars,
                   FID), as well as to their relative brain size (RBS),
                   a correlate of measures of behavioral flexibility.
                   Principal Findings: Urban invasiveness was not
                   significantly related to species' average rural FIDs
                   but positively related to their RBS and
                   inter-individual variability in FID. Moreover, FIDs
                   were consistently lower in urban than in rural
                   conspecifics, and the FIDs of urban individuals were
                   within the lower-range distribution of their rural
                   conspecifics. RBS indirectly influenced urban
                   invasion through its positive effect on
                   inter-individual variability in FID.
                   Conclusions/Significance: Urban invaders do not
                   appear to be individuals from apparently tame
                   species, but rather tame individuals from species
                   with a variable response regarding fear of people.
                   Given the positive relationship between RBS and
                   inter-individual variability in FID, our results
                   suggest that behavioural flexibility should be
                   regarded as a specific trait encompassing variability
                   among individuals. Further research is needed to
                   ascertain the neurophysiological mechanisms
                   underlying the relationship between brain size and
                   inter-individual variability in behavioural traits.

                   which they have had no opportunity to adapt and even
                   become more abundant than many native species?
                   Ecological theory suggests two main possible answers
                   for this paradox: competitive superiority of exotic
                   species over native species and opportunistic use of
                   ecological opportunities derived from human
                   activities. We tested these hypotheses in birds
                   combining field observations and experiments along
                   gradients of urbanization in New South Wales
                   (Australia). Five exotic species attained densities
                   in the study area comparable to those of the most
                   abundant native species, and hence provided a case
                   for the invasion paradox. The success of these alien
                   birds was not primarily associated with a competitive
                   superiority over native species: the most successful
                   invaders were smaller and less aggressive than their
                   main native competitors, and were generally excluded
                   from artificially created food patches where
                   competition was high. More importantly, exotic birds
                   were primarily restricted to urban environments,
                   where the diversity and abundance of native species
                   were low. This finding agrees with previous studies
                   and indicates that exotic and native species rarely
                   interact in nature. Observations and experiments in
                   the field revealed that the few native species that
                   exploit the most urbanized environments tended to be
                   opportunistic foragers, adaptations that should
                   facilitate survival in places where disturbances by
                   humans are frequent and natural vegetation has been
                   replaced by man-made structures. Successful invaders
                   also shared these features, suggesting that their
                   success is not a paradox but can be explained by
                   their capacity to exploit ecological opportunities
                   that most native species rarely use. {\textcopyright}

                   flee, but we lack an understanding of the factors
                   that influence flight response among species.
                   Understanding this variation may allow us to
                   understand how 'fear' structures communities, as well
                   as to predict which species are likely to coexist
                   with humans. I used flight initiation distance (FID)
                   as a comparative metric of wariness and examined the
                   relative importance of life history and natural
                   history traits in explaining variation in FID in 150
                   species of birds. In a series of comparative
                   analyses, I used independent contrasts to control for
                   phylogenetic similarity and regressed continuous life
                   history traits against flight initiation distance.
                   Body size had a large and significant effect in
                   explaining variation in flightiness: larger species
                   initiated flight at greater distances than smaller
                   species. After controlling for variation explained by
                   body size, there was a nonsignificant positive
                   relation between the age of first reproduction and
                   FID. There were no relations between FID and clutch
                   size, number of days spent feeding young, longevity,
                   or habitat density. I used concentrated changes tests
                   to look for evidence of coevolution between
                   flightiness and dichotomous traits. Flightiness
                   evolved multiple times and some clades were flightier
                   than others. Flightiness was more likely to evolve in
                   omnivorous/carnivorous species and in cooperatively
                   breeding species. These results suggest that body
                   size and age of first reproduction are important in
                   explaining variation in disturbance tolerance in
                   birds, and that species that capture live prey and
                   those that are highly social are relatively wary. The
                   results suggest a novel mechanism of how

                   distinct ways. Prospective analyses (sensitivity and
                   elasticity) explore the functional dependence of
                   $\lambda$ on the vital rates. They predict the
                   changes in $\lambda$ that would result from any
                   specified change in the vital rates and are
                   independent of previous patterns of variability of
                   the vital rates. Retrospective analyses (life table
                   response experiment [LTRE] methods and other kinds of
                   variance decomposition) express observed variation in
                   $\lambda$ as a function of observed (co)variation in
                   the vital rates. Their results are specific to the
                   observed pattern of variation. Sensitivity and
                   elasticity analysis can be used to identify potential
                   management targets because changes in vital rates
                   with high sensitivity or elasticity will produce
                   large changes in $\lambda$. Sometimes that potential
                   may not be realized because it is difficult or
                   impossible to change those vital rates. Retrospective
                   analyses cannot identify potential management targets
                   because they compare the contributions of past
                   changes in vital rates, not the effects of future
                   changes. Just as the results of heritability analysis
                   say nothing about the efficacy of clinical
                   treatments, so the results of retrospective analysis
                   say nothing about the efficacy of potential
                   management tactics. Perturbation analysis is a
                   powerful tool with important implications for
                   conservation. It is important that perturbation
                   analyses be applied properly.},

                   substantially when effects of phylogeny and body size
                   were statistically removed. Empirical support for

                   analyses of elasticities on the basis of the
                   magnitude (F) and onset ($\alpha$) of reproduction
                   revealed that $\alpha$, followed by F, had the
                   largest relative influence on $\lambda$ in
                   populations characterized by early maturity and high
                   reproductive rates, or when F/$\alpha$ {\textgreater}
                   0.60. When maturity was delayed and reproductive
                   rates were low, or when F/$\alpha$ {\textless} 0.15,
                   survival rates were overwhelmingly most influential,
                   and reproductive parameters ($\alpha$ and F) had
                   little relative influence on $\lambda$. Population

                   age-structured populations on the basis of values of

  abstract =      {Aim: As urban landscapes expand, shifts in
                   biodiversity are occurring. This is leading
                   biogeographers and ecologists to consider
                   human-dominated landscapes in their current work. One
                   question that arises is: what characterizes those
                   species that are widespread in the most highly urban
                   environments compared with those restricted to less
                   urbanized areas in the city? Here, we aim to identify
                   the traits that enable species to become urban
                   exploiters, i.e. to dominate highly urbanized
                   surroundings. Identifying these traits may help us
                   better predict and possibly mitigate the biotic
                   homogenization occurring in these areas. Location:
                   Israel in general, with special focus on the city of
                   Jerusalem. Methods: Combining literature and
                   field-based data for birds in Israel we compared
                   phenotypic, behavioural and life-history traits
                   between urban exploiters and urban adapters. The
                   latter occur in urban landscapes, but are
                   characteristic of the less urbanized parts of the
                   city. We then examined the trends along a finer
                   field-sampled gradient of increasing urbanization
                   from sub-natural to downtown areas within the city of
                   Jerusalem. Results: Urban exploiters and adapters
                   differed primarily in social structure and migratory
                   status: exploiters were significantly more social and
                   sedentary than urban adapters. Clear trends were also
                   seen for dietary preferences along a gradient of
                   increasing urbanization in Jerusalem, such that, with
                   increasing urbanization, the proportion of
                   granivorous species increased whereas the proportion
                   of species feeding on invertebrates declined. In
                   contrast, neither relative brain size nor behavioural
                   flexibility, as measured by feeding innovations,
                   differed significantly among urban exploiters and
                   adapters in Israel or along the urbanization gradient
                   in Jerusalem specifically. Main conclusions: The
                   results of our study suggest that being successful in
                   more vs. less urbanized environments in the city is
                   not necessarily a factor of brain size nor of how
                   flexible and behaviourally innovative the species is;
                   rather, it depends on a combination of traits,
                   including diet, degree of sociality, sedentariness
                   and preferred nesting sites. {\textcopyright} 2007

                   Identifying the biological traits that determine
                   which species are likely to succeed in urbanized
                   habitats is important for predicting global trends in
                   biodiversity. We provide the first evidence for the
                   intuitive yet untested hypothesis that relative brain
                   size is a key factor predisposing animals to
                   successful establishment in cities. We apply
                   phylogenetic mixed modelling in a Bayesian framework
                   to show that passerine species that succeed in
                   colonizing at least one of 12 European cities are
                   more likely to belong to big-brained lineages than
                   species avoiding these urban areas. These data
                   support findings linking relative brain size with the

                   in vertebrate populations, and have important

  abstract =      {For an animal invading a novel region, the ability to
                   develop new behaviors should facilitate the use of
                   novel food resources and hence increase its survival
                   in the new environment. However, the need to explore
                   new resources may entail costs such as exposing the
                   animal to unfamiliar predators. These two opposing
                   forces result in an exploration-avoidance conflict,
                   which can be expected to interfere with the
                   acquisition of new resources. However, its
                   consequences should be less dramatic in highly
                   urbanized environments where new food opportunities
                   are common and predation risk is low. We tested this
                   hypothesis experimentally by presenting three
                   foraging tasks to introduced common mynas
                   (Acridotheres tristis) from environments with low and
                   high urbanization levels from Australia. Individuals
                   from the highly urbanized environments, where mynas
                   are both more opportunistic when foraging and less
                   fearful to predators, resolved a technical task
                   faster than those from less urbanized environments.
                   These differences did not reflect innovative
                   'personalities' and were not confounded by sex,
                   morphology or motivational state. Rather, the
                   principal factors underlying differences in mynas'
                   problem-solving ability were neophobic-neophilic
                   responses, which varied across habitats. Thus, mynas
                   seem to modulate their problem-solving ability
                   according to the benefits and costs of innovating in
                   their particular habitat, which may help us
                   understand the great success of the species in highly
                   urbanized environments.},

                   comparative biology were originally developed in
                   quantitative genetics, subsequent development of
                   comparative techniques has progressed in relative
                   isolation. Consequently, many of the new and planned
                   developments in comparative analysis already have
                   well-tested solutions in quantitative genetics. In
                   this paper, we take three recent publications that
                   develop phylogenetic meta-analysis, either implicitly
                   or explicitly, and show how they can be considered as
                   quantitative genetic models. We highlight some of the
                   difficulties with the proposed solutions, and
                   demonstrate that standard quantitative genetic theory
                   and software offer solutions. We also show how
                   results from Bayesian quantitative genetics can be
                   used to create efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo
                   algorithms for phylogenetic mixed models, thereby
                   extending their generality to non-Gaussian data. Of
                   particular utility is the development of multinomial
                   models for analysing the evolution of discrete
                   traits, and the development of multi-trait models in
                   which traits can follow different distributions.
                   Meta-analyses often include a nonrandom collection of
                   species for which the full phylogenetic tree has only
                   been partly resolved. Using missing data theory, we
                   show how the presented models can be used to correct
                   for nonrandom sampling and show how taxonomies and
                   phylogenies can be combined to give a flexible
                   framework with which to model dependence.},

                   to build models of causal hypotheses among variables
                   and test if the data conform with the causal model.
                   However, classical path analysis techniques ignore
                   the nonindependence of observations due to
                   phylogenetic relatedness among species, possibly
                   leading to spurious results. Here, we present a
                   simple method to perform phylogenetic confirmatory
                   path analysis (PPA). We analyzed simulated datasets
                   with varying amounts of phylogenetic signal in the
                   data and a known underlying causal structure linking
                   the traits to estimate Type I error and power.
                   Results show that Type I error for PPA appeared to be
                   slightly anticonservative (range: 0.047-0.072) but
                   path analysis models ignoring phylogenetic signal
                   resulted in much higher Type I error rates, which
                   were positively related to the amount of phylogenetic
                   signal (range: 0.051 for $\lambda$= 0 to 0.916 for
                   $\lambda$= 1). Further, the power of the test was not
                   compromised when accounting for phylogeny. As an
                   example of the application of PPA, we revisit a study
                   on the correlates of aggressive broodmate competition
                   across seven avian families. The use of PPA allowed
                   us to gain greater insight into the plausible causal
                   paths linking species traits to aggressive broodmate
                   competition.},

                   biologists are often impervious to experimental
                   approaches, and alternative methods have to be
                   adopted. The phy-logenetic comparative approach is a
                   very powerful one since it combines a large number of
                   species and thus spans long periods of evolutionary
                   change. However, there are limits to the inferences
                   that can be drawn from the results, in part due to
                   the limitations of the most commonly employed
                   analytical methods. In this chapter, we show how
                   confirmatory path analysis can be undertaken
                   explicitly controlling for non-independence due to
                   shared ancestry. The phylogenetic path analysis
                   method we present allows researchers to move beyond
                   the estimation of direct effects and analyze the
                   relative importance of alternative causal models
                   including direct and indirect paths of influence
                   among variables. We begin the chapter with a general
                   introduction to path analysis and then present a
                   step-by-step guide to phylogenetic path analysis
                   using the d-separation method. We also show how the
                   known statistical problems associated with
                   non-independence of data points due to shared
                   ancestry become compounded in path analysis. We
                   finish with a discussion about the potential effects
                   of collinearity and measurement error, and a look
                   toward possible future developments. Both authors

                   associations in comparative studies. To investigate
                   this question, we explore the use of a measure of
                   phylogenetic correlation, l, introduced by Pagel
                   (1999), that normally varies between 0 (phylogenetic
                   independence) and 1 (species' traits covary in direct
                   proportion to their shared evolutionary his- tory).
                   Simulations show l to be a statistically powerful
                   index for measuring whether data exhibit phylogenetic
                   dependence or not and whether it has low rates of
                   Type I error. Moreover, l is robust to incomplete
                   phylogenetic information, which demonstrates that
                   even partial information on phylogeny will improve
                   the accuracy of phy- logenetic analyses. To assess
                   whether traits generally show phyloge- netic
                   associations, we present a quantitative review of 26
                   published phylogenetic comparative data sets. The
                   data sets include 103 traits and were chosen from the
                   ecological literature in which debate about the need
                   for phylogenetic correction has been most acute.
                   Eighty- eight percent of data sets contained at least
                   one character that dis- played significant
                   phylogenetic dependence, and 60{\%} of characters
                   overall (pooled across studies) showed significant
                   evidence of phylogenetic association. In 16{\%} of
                   tests, phylogenetic correlation could be neither
                   supported nor rejected. However, most of these
                   equivocal results were found in small phylogenies and
                   probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the
                   parameter l be routinely estimated when analyzing
                   comparative data, since it can also be used
                   simultaneously to adjust the phylogenetic correction
                   in a manner that is optimal for the data set, and we
                   present an example of how this may be done.},

                   approaching predators and responding accordingly.
                   Such an assessment may result in prey–predator
                   communication and signalling, which entail further
                   monitoring of the predator by prey. An early
                   antipredator response may provide potential prey with
                   a selective advantage, although this benefit comes at
                   the cost of disturbance in terms of lost foraging
                   opportunities and increased energy expenditure.
                   Therefore, it may pay prey to assess approaching
                   predators and determine the likelihood of attack
                   before fleeing. Given that many approaching potential
                   predators are detected visually, we hypothesized that
                   species with relatively large eyes would be able to
                   detect an approaching predator from afar.
                   Furthermore, we hypothesized that monitoring of
                   predators by potential prey relies on evaluation
                   through information processing by the brain.
                   Therefore, species with relatively larger brains for
                   their body size should be better able to monitor the
                   intentions of a predator, delay flight for longer and
                   hence have shorter flight initiation distances than
                   species with smaller brains. Indeed, flight
                   initiation distances increased with relative eye size
                   and decreased with relative brain size in a
                   comparative study of 107 species of birds. In
                   addition, flight initiation distance increased
                   independently with size of the cerebellum, which
                   plays a key role in motor control. These results are
                   consistent with cognitive monitoring as an
                   antipredator behaviour that does not result in the
                   fastest possible, but rather the least expensive
                   escape flights. Therefore, antipredator behaviour may
                   have coevolved with the size of sense organs, brains
                   and compartments of the brain involved in responses
                   to risk of predation.},

                   These include loss of fear of humans, reduced
                   corticosterone levels, prolonged breeding seasons,
                   and several others. Here, I test the hypothesis that
                   urbanization results from differential colonization
                   of urban areas by species with heterogeneous levels
                   of fear in the ancestral rural populations, followed
                   by a reduction in variance in fear responses with a
                   subsequent increase in diversity of fear responses as
                   urban populations become adapted to the urban
                   environment. Using information on variance in flight
                   initiation distances (FIDs) when approached by a
                   human, I show that rural populations of birds
                   characterized by short mean flight distances and
                   large variances in flight distances differentially
                   colonized urban areas. As a consequence of this urban
                   invasion, urban populations lost variation in FID.
                   The variance in FID was initially larger in rural
                   than in urban populations but eventually became
                   larger in urban populations with time since
                   urbanization. This secondary increase in variance in
                   FID of urban populations was associated with an
                   increase in population density of urban populations,

                   and thereby gained an advantage in a world
                   increasingly affected by human activity. Numerous
                   organisms have invaded novel areas and thereby
                   increased their range. Here, we hypothesize that an
                   ability to thrive in urban habitats is a key
                   innovation that facilitates successful establishment
                   and invasion. We test this hypothesis by relating the
                   probability of establishment by birds on oceanic
                   islands to the difference in breeding population
                   density between urban and nearby rural habitats as a
                   measure of urbanization in the ancestral range. This
                   measure was the single-most important predictor of
                   establishment success and the only statistically
                   significant one, with additional effects of sexual
                   dichromatism, number of releases and release effort,
                   showing that the ability to cope with human proximity
                   is a central component of successful establishment.
                   Because most invasions occur as a consequence of
                   human-assisted establishment, the ability to cope
                   with human proximity will often be of central
                   importance for successful establishment.},

  abstract =      {Practically all animals are affected by humans,
                   especially in urban areas. Although most species
                   respond negatively to urbanization, some thrive in
                   human-dominated settings. A central question in urban
                   ecology is why some species adapt well to the
                   presence of humans and others do not. We show that
                   Northern Mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos) nesting on
                   the campus of a large university rapidly learn to
                   assess the level of threat posed by different humans,
                   and to respond accordingly. In a controlled
                   experiment, we found that as the same human
                   approached and threatened a nest on 4 successive
                   days, mockingbirds flushed from their nest at
                   increasingly greater distances from that human. A
                   different human approaching and threatening the nest
                   identically on the fifth day elicited the same
                   response as the first human on the first day.
                   Likewise, alarm calls and attack flights increased
                   from days 1-4 with the first human, and decreased on
                   day 5 with the second human. These results
                   demonstrate a remarkable ability of a passerine bird
                   to distinguish one human from thousands of others.
                   Also, mockingbirds learned to identify individual
                   humans extraordinarily quickly: after only 2 30-s
                   exposures of the human at the nest. More generally,
                   the varying responses of mockingbirds to intruders
                   suggests behavioral flexibility and a keen awareness
                   of different levels of threat posed by individuals of
                   another species: traits that may predispose
                   mockingbirds and other species of urban wildlife to
                   successful exploitation of human-dominated
                   environments.},

  abstract =      {The ability to distinguish among heterospecific
                   individuals has been reported in only a few animal
                   species. Humans can be viewed as a special type of
                   heterospecifics because individuals differ widely in
                   behavior, ranging from non-threatening to very
                   threatening toward animals. In this study, we asked
                   whether wild magpies can recognize individual humans
                   who had accessed their nests. We compared the
                   behavior of breeding pairs toward individual humans
                   before and after the humans climbed up to the birds'
                   nests, and also toward climbers and non-climbers. We
                   have evidence for (i) aggressive responses of the
                   magpie pairs toward humans who had repeatedly
                   accessed their nests (climbers) and a lack of
                   response to humans who had not accessed the nest
                   (non-climbers); (ii) a total lack of scolding
                   responses toward climbers by magpie pairs whose nests
                   had not been accessed; (iii) a selective aggressive
                   response to the climber when a climber and a
                   non-climber were presented simultaneously. Taken
                   together, these results suggest that wild magpies can
                   distinguish individual humans that pose a threat to
                   their nests from humans that have not behaved in a
                   threatening way. The magpie is only the third avian
                   species, along with crows and mockingbirds, in which
                   recognition of individual humans has been documented
                   in the wild. Here, we propose a new hypothesis
                   (adopted from psychology) that frequent previous
                   exposure to humans in urban habitats contributes to
                   the ability of birds to discriminate among human
                   individuals. This mechanism, along with high
                   cognitive abilities, may predispose some species to
                   learn to discriminate among human individuals.
                   Experimental tests of these two mechanisms are
                   proposed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract =      {Animal personality has become a major topic in animal
                   behaviour. Much recent progress has come from the use
                   of the open-field test, which is routinely used to
                   separate individuals into fast and slow explorers.
                   However, there is no standard way to conduct the test
                   and it is unclear whether the test really measures
                   exploration. Here, we addressed these issues by
                   combining an open-field test with a battery of
                   independent assays intended to assess the convergent
                   and discriminant validity of the behavioural traits
                   suggested to measure exploration in the open-field
                   test. Our study subjects were common mynas,
                   Acridotheres tristis, introduced to Australia. The
                   analyses confirmed that the open-field test allows
                   individuals to be separated according to their
                   propensity to explore, mainly through metrics related
                   to spatial and object examination of the novel cage.
                   However, other metrics classically used to describe
                   exploratory behaviour, such as the latency to enter
                   the novel space, reflected shyness rather than
                   exploration. The open-field test can therefore be a
                   powerful tool to investigate personality, but only if
                   the biological meanings of the metrics derived from
                   the test are properly validated with independent
                   behavioural assays.},

                   size, and the frequency of foraging innovations
                   reported in the literature for both birds and
                   primates. In birds, foraging innovations have been
                   observed in over 800 species, and include behaviours
                   that range from eating a novel food to using tools.
                   Previous comparative studies have quantified
                   innovativeness by summing all reports of innovative
                   behaviour, regardless of the nature of the
                   innovation. Here, we use the variety of foraging
                   innovations recorded for birds to see which of two
                   classic hypotheses best accounts for the relationship
                   between innovativeness and brain size: the technical
                   intelligence hypothesis or the
                   opportunistic-generalism intelligence hypothesis. We
                   classified 2182 innovation cases into 12 categories
                   to quantify the diversity of innovations performed by
                   each of 76 avian families. We found that families
                   with larger brains had a greater repertoire of
                   innovations, and that innovation diversity was a
                   stronger predictor of residual brain size than was
                   total number of innovations. Furthermore, the
                   diversity of technical innovations displayed by bird
                   families was a much better predictor of residual
                   brain size than was the number of food type
                   innovations, providing support for the technical
                   intelligence hypothesis. Our results suggest that the
                   cognitive capacity required to perform a wide variety
                   of novel foraging techniques underpins the positive
                   relationship between innovativeness and brain size in

                   behavioral traits are more labile}},
  volume =        {57},
  year =          {2003},
  abstract =      {The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically
                   based statistical methods is that phylogenetic
                   signal, the tendency for related species to resemble
                   each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is
                   true for a given trait in a given lineage is an
                   empirical question, but general tools for detecting
                   and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately
                   developed. We present new methods for
                   continuous-valued characters that can be implemented
                   with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or
                   generalized least-squares models. First, a simple
                   randomization procedure allows one to test the null
                   hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among
                   relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error
                   rate at a nominal alpha = 0.05 and good power (0.8)
                   for simulated datasets with 20 or more species.
                   Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which
                   allows valid comparisons of the amount of
                   phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third,
                   we provide two biologically motivated branch-length
                   transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
                   (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based
                   on a new model in which character evolution can
                   accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may
                   occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum
                   likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g)
                   parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal
                   because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that
                   a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a
                   star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations
                   that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data
                   will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and
                   may also be preferable for further comparative
                   analyses, such as of correlated character evolution.
                   Application of the methods to data from the
                   literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more
                   species, 92{\%} of traits exhibited significant
                   phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including
                   behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be
                   relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly
                   adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong
                   environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of
                   measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most
                   traits (but not body size, on average) showed less
                   signal than expected given the topology, branch
                   lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution
                   (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed
                   to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad
                   sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes,
                   branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance
                   of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated
                   that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body
                   size, morphological, life-history, or physiological
                   traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected

                   itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the
                   estimated OU (25{\%} of traits) and/or ACDC (40{\%})
                   transformation parameter differed significantly from
                   both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical
                   tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than
                   the original better fit the data and so could be
                   preferred for comparative analyses.},

                   particularly advantageous during adverse
                   environmental conditions because the ability to
                   withstand proximity to humans allows for exploitation
                   of abundant food. We carried out flight initiation
                   distance experiments in 207 bird species in 7 pairs
                   of urban–rural areas from northern to southern
                   Europe before and after the extremely cold winter of
                   2009–2010. Flight initiation distance in different
                   species of birds on average became shorter after the
                   cold winter, but only in resident urban populations
                   (frequently exposed to humans) and not in migratory
                   or rural populations of the same species. There were
                   independent partial effects of human population
                   density with an increase in flight initiation
                   distance from before to after the cold winter of
                   2009–2010 at low population densities and a
                   decrease at high population densities, and there was
                   an independent effect of latitude with the flight
                   initiation distance increasing from 2009 to 2010 at
                   low latitudes and decreasing from 2009 to 2010 at
                   high latitudes. The difference in flight initiation
                   distance before and after the cold winter increased
                   with severity of the winter across different study
                   areas. Therefore, the difference in flight initiation
                   distance between urban and rural habitats increased
                   after the cold winter, especially in areas with the
                   coldest winter weather. These findings are consistent
                   with the hypothesis that a behavioral component of
                   urbanization is due to reduced flight initiation
                   distance in urban environments and suggest that
                   weather conditions (i.e., cold winters) have played
                   an important role in the process of urbanization.},

                   produce as many nestlings as they can, on the
                   average, adequately nourish, is considered in
                   relation to the Central American avifauna. Birds
                   whose usual rate of bringing food to the nest is slow
                   can greatly augment this rate if, after an
                   exceptionally long period of neglect, they find their
                   nestlings unusually hungry (examples are given for
                   two species of antbirds), or if an additional
                   nestling is placed in the nest (an experiment with a
                   tanager is described). In four out of five cases,
                   birds of four kinds in which the clutch consists
                   almost invariably of two eggs succeeded in rearing
                   three nestlings. In numerous species of hummingbirds,
                   manakins, cotingas, American flycatchers, Icteridae,
                   etc., the male does not help to feed the nestlings;
                   yet these birds nearly all rear broods of two, which
                   in the same habitats is the prevalent size among
                   species in which both parents attend the nest. If the
                   latter were rearing as many young as they could
                   properly provide for, we should expect the unmated
                   females to lay clutches only half as big. Among
                   flycatchers, when the female alone feeds the
                   nestlings, their period in the nest is not
                   significantly longer than at comparable nests of
                   species in which both parents feed. Also in
                   nidifugous species, of which the chicks pick up their
                   own food under parental guidance, clutches are far
                   smaller in the Tropics than in the North. On the
                   basis of the time spent away from the nest by 18
                   incubating finches of 9 species, it is estimated that
                   on the average 4 hours per day suffice each parent to
                   find all the food it needs, preen, bathe, and perform
                   other necessary activities. This would leave each
                   parent, of the tropical species, about 8-5 hours to
                   devote to the feeding of the nestlings; both together
                   would have 17 hours per day. Even allowing 5
                   bird-hours for each nestling, the two parents
                   together could attend 3; yet 7 of the 8 tropical
                   species considered regularly lay sets of only 2 eggs.
                   Even when the climate appears to be favourable
                   through much or all of the year, the breeding-season
                   of many tropical birds is short and the number of
                   broods small. The fact that some individuals breed
                   successfully at seasons when most members of the same
                   species are resting from reproduction, points
                   strongly to the conclusion that these birds do not
                   attempt as many broods as they might successfully
                   rear. Neither in the size of their broods, nor in the
                   number per year, do tropical birds in general appear
                   to rear as many offspring as their own powers and the
                   environment would permit. Their rate of reproduction
                   seems to be adjusted to their average annual
                   mortality rather than pushed to the limits of their
                   strength. Two species of Tyrannidse, Myiozetetes
                   similis and M. granadensis, are similar in appearance
                   and habits and often build their nests in the same
                   trees, but differ in their rate of reproduction. In
                   the midst of their ranges, it does not appear that
                   the more prolific M. similis has any advantage over
                   its congener. In a hypothetical species which with a
                   clutch-size of two keeps its range occupied at a high
                   or optimum density, the fate of a three-egg mutant is
                   considered. It would be difficult for the more
                   fertile genotype to displace the well-established
                   two-egg strain, unless some catastrophe caused a
                   severe reduction in the density of the population.
                   Such catastrophes are rare in the humid Tropics. The
                   situation is radically different in a species
                   expanding into a new area, or in one increasing
                   rapidly in numbers after a great reduction in density
                   of population. In these cases intraspecific
                   competition is at a minimum, and the more prolific
                   strains will tend to predominate. At high latitudes,
                   recurrent drastic reductions in density as a result
                   of great cold, famine, or disasters during migration,
                   are followed by periods of free expansion; and under
                   these circumstances it is likely that the rate of
                   reproduction will be held to near the maximum which
                   combined internal and external conditions allow.
                   Lack's views appear to fit the facts in relation to
                   the northern birds which he investigated, but seem to
                   be in accord neither with observations nor theory
                   when applied to the birds of humid tropical areas,
                   where ecological catastrophes are at most rare and
                   local.},

  abstract =      {Allometric laws which scale numerous biomechanical
                   and physiological processes to size in mammals have
                   long been recognized and widely used in biology.
                   There is now sufficient evidence to suggest that
                   those life history parameters such as growth and
                   maximum rates of reproduction, which depend in part
                   on metabolic rate, are also scaled to size. Data are
                   presented which, coupled with a literature review,
                   show that gestation time, growth rates, age at first
                   reproduction, lifespan, the intrinsic rate of natural
                   increase, birth rate, net reproductive rate and
                   litter weight are allometrically scaled to size and
                   are, in consequence, inter-related. The exponents of
                   the scaling functions are similar in all mammalian
                   orders but in some taxa such as the primates, the
                   species grow slower, live longer and reproduce at a
                   lower rate. For these taxa the differences in life
                   history parameters can be explained by differences in
                   brain size and an existing hypothesis that the
                   maximum rate of neural tissue growth constrains the
                   maximum rate of growth and development of the entire
                   organism. It is then argued that because size scales
                   the main life history parameters of mammals it should
                   also be a central theme in ecology from the
                   individual to the community level of organisation.
                   Examples are presented to show that size is
                   ubiquitous in ecology and accounts for most of the
                   variation in life history parameters between species.
                   Size scaling offers a method of reducing species of
                   varying size to similar dimensions of time, space and
                   rates of action. It is therefore fundamental in
                   distinguishing those life history parameters which
                   arise as a consequence of size, the first order
                   strategies, from those that vary between populations
                   and according to environmental circumstances, the
                   second order strategies. From this approach should
                   develop a broader biological synthesis in which
                   genetic and physiological determinants will
                   inevitably feature more centrally than they do in
                   ecological and behavioural theory.},

  abstract =      {The tremendous variation in the life-history patterns
                   of organisms is best explained as adaptive.any
                   organism has a limited amount of resources at its
                   disposal, and these have to be partitioned between
                   reproductive and nonreproductive activities. A larger
                   share of resources to reproductive activities, that
                   is, a higher reproductive effort at any age, leads to
                   a better reproductive performance at that age; this
                   may be considered a as profit function. This
                   reproductive effort also leads to a reduction in
                   survival and growth and consequent diminution of the
                   reproductive contribution of the succeeding stages in
                   the life history; this may be considered as a cost
                   function. Natural selection would tend to an
                   adjustment of the reproductive effort at every age
                   such that the overall fitness of the life history
                   would be maximized. A model of life history processes
                   has been developed on the basis of these
                   considerations. It leads to the following
                   predictions: 1. If the form of the profit function is
                   convex, or that of the cost function concave, the
                   optimal strategy may be to breed repeatedly.

                   reproduction). 2. The value of reproductive effort
                   continuously increases with age in the case of
                   repeated reproducers. 3. If all the stages in the
                   life history following a certain age are adversely
                   affected, the age of reproduction will tend to be
                   lowered in the case of big-bang reproducers, and the
                   reproductive effort at all ages preceding that stage
                   will tend to increase in the case of repeated
                   reproducers. 4. As the reproductive potential
                   increases with size at a slower rate, reproductive
                   effort will be lower at maturity, reproductive effort
                   will increase at a higher rate with age, and growth
                   will continue beyond maturity. 5. A uniform change in
                   the probability of survival from one age to the next
                   at all ages would have no effect by itself, on the
                   age of reproduction in big-bang breeders or on the
                   distribution of reproductive effort with age in the
                   repeated reproducers. 6. Such a change in
                   survivorship would lead to a change in the
                   equilibrium density of a population. If the
                   population is resource limited, this would affect the
                   availability of resources to the members, of the
                   population in such a way that an increase in
                   mortality would increase the availability of the
                   resources. 7. For a resource-limited organism a
                   greater availability of resources would lead to a
                   lowering of the age of reproduction in the case of
                   the big-bang breeders, and to a greater reproductive
                   effort at ail ages for the repeated breeders.},

  abstract =      {This review organizes ideas on the evolution of life
                   histories. The key life-history traits are brood
                   size, size of young, the age distribution of
                   reproductive effort, the interaction of reproductive
                   effort with adutl mortality, and the variation in
                   these traits among an individual's progeny. The
                   general theoretical problem is to predict which
                   combinations of traits will evolve in organisms
                   living in specified circumstances. First consider
                   single traits. Theorists have made the following
                   predictions: (1) Where adult exceeds juvenile
                   mortality, the organism should reproduce only once in
                   its lifetime. Where juvenile exceeds adult mortality,
                   the organism should reproduce several times. (2)
                   Brood size should maximize the number of young
                   surviving to maturity, summed over the lifetime of
                   the parent. But when optimum brood-size varies
                   unpredictably in time, smaller broods should be
                   favored because they decrease the chances of total
                   failure on a given attempt. (3) In expanding
                   populations, selection should minimize age at
                   maturity. In stable populations, when reproductive
                   success depends on size, age, or social status, or
                   when adult exceeds juvenile mortality, then
                   maturation should be delayed, as it should be in
                   declining populations. (4) Young should increase in
                   size at birth with increased predation risk, and
                   decrease in size with increased resource
                   availability. Theorists have also predicted that only
                   particular combinations of traits should occur in
                   specified circumstances. (5) In growing populations,
                   age at maturity should be minimized, reproductive
                   effort concentrated early in life, and brood size
                   increased. (6) One view holds that in stable
                   environments, late maturity, multiple broods, a few,
                   large young, parental care, and small reproductive
                   efforts should be favored (K-selection). In
                   fluctuating environments, early maturity, many small
                   young, reduced parental care, and large reproductive
                   efforts should be favored (r-selection). (7) But
                   another view holds that when juvenile mortality
                   fluctuates more than adult mortality, the traits
                   associated with stable and fluctuating environments
                   should be reversed. We need experiments that test the
                   assumptions and predictions reviewed here, more
                   comprehensive theory that makes more readily
                   falsifiable predictions, and examination of different
                   definitions of fitness.},

  abstract =      {Maximum lifespan in birds and mammals varies strongly
                   with body mass such that large species tend to live
                   longer than smaller species. However, many species
                   live far longer than expected given their body mass.
                   This may reflect interspecific variation in extrinsic
                   mortality, as life-history theory predicts investment
                   in long-term survival is under positive selection
                   when extrinsic mortality is reduced. Here, we
                   investigate how multiple ecological and mode-of-life
                   traits that should reduce extrinsic mortality
                   (including volancy (flight capability), activity
                   period, foraging environment and fossoriality),
                   simultaneously influence lifespan across endotherms.
                   Using novel phylogenetic comparative analyses and to
                   our knowledge, the most species analysed to date (n =
                   1368), we show that, over and above the effect of
                   body mass, the most important factor enabling longer
                   lifespan is the ability to fly. Within volant
                   species, lifespan depended upon when (day, night,
                   dusk or dawn), but not where (in the air, in trees or
                   on the ground), species are active. However, the
                   opposite was true for non-volant species, where
                   lifespan correlated positively with both arboreality
                   and fossoriality. Our results highlight that when
                   studying the molecular basis behind cellular
                   processes such as those underlying lifespan, it is
                   important to consider the ecological selection
                   pressures that shaped them over evolutionary time.

                   of data containing many different life-history
                   parameters. Currently, life-history data for amniotes
                   (birds, mammals, and reptiles) are split among a

                   pressure, a composite measure of the number of
                   individuals released into the nonnative location that
                   varies between intro- duction events, is the most
                   consistent predictor of success in the establishment
                   of exotic species. However, the reasons why we expect
                   propagule pressure to be important – because larger
                   propagules ameliorate the effects of demographic,
                   environmental or genetic stochasticity, or of Allee
                   effects – also predict an influence of species
                   traits on success. Here, we use a quantitative
                   meta-analytical approach to assess the effect of
                   three categories of species-level traits in the
                   successful establishment of nonnative bird species:
                   traits relating to population growth rates, traits
                   that predispose species to Allee effects, and traits
                   that enable a species to cope with novel
                   environments. Traits that predispose species to Allee
                   effects tend to decrease introduction success,
                   whereas traits that enable a species to cope with
                   novel environments tend to increase success. The
                   breadth of habitats a species uses has the strongest
                   mean effect of all variables analysed here. Mean
                   effects for traits relating to population growth
                   rates conflict in sign: in general, success is
                   greater for species with large body mass whereas
                   clutch size is not consistently related to
                   establishment success. These results suggest a likely
                   influence of some species-level traits on exotic bird
                   establishment success, especially traits that enable
                   a species to cope with novel environments. We suggest
                   that considering such traits in terms of the
                   small-population paradigm from conservation biology

                   characteristics allow them to persist. To address
                   this question, we identified 190 mammals regularly
                   recorded in urban settlements worldwide, and used

                   primates, indicative of an across-species general
                   intelligence that includes elements of cultural
                   intelligence. Our composite species-level measure of
                   general intelligence, 'primate gs', covaried with
                   both brain volume and captive learning performance
                   measures. Our findings question the independence of
                   cognitive traits and do not support 'massive
                   modularity' in primate cognition, nor an exclusively
                   social model of primate intelligence. High general
                   intelligence has independently evolved at least four
                   times, with convergent evolution in capuchins,
                   baboons, macaques and great apes. {\textcopyright}

  abstract =      {Urbanization is a major driver of local biodiversity
                   losses, but the traits that determine whether species
                   are able to tolerate urban environments remain poorly
                   understood. Theory suggests that a larger brain
                   should provide higher tolerance to urbanization by
                   enhancing behavioral flexibility to cope with novel
                   challenges. However, assembling empirical evidence
                   for a link between brain size and tolerance to
                   urbanization has proven to be difficult, perhaps
                   because the effect of the brain interacts with life
                   history to influence persistence in urban
                   environments. Here, we provide a global-scale
                   assessment of the role of brain size on urban
                   tolerance, combining quantitative estimations of
                   urban tolerance with detailed information on brain
                   size, life history and ecology for 629 avian species
                   across 27 cities. Our analysis confirms the expected
                   positive association between brain size and urban
                   tolerance, but shows that the relationship is more
                   complex than previously shown. While a large relative
                   brain size generally increases urban tolerance,
                   species with small brains can still attain high
                   success in urban environments if they spread the risk
                   of reproduction across multiple events (i.e., have a
                   low brood value). These alternative strategies,
                   although uncommon in natural conditions, seem to be
                   favored in urban environments, fundamentally
                   restructuring the composition of urban communities.
                   Thus, our results support the notion that brain size
                   mediates tolerance to urbanization, but also shows
                   that there are alternative ways of exploiting urban
                   environments. Our findings reconcile previous
                   conflicting results regarding the effect of brain
                   size on urban tolerance, and provide the basis for
                   improved predictions of the responses of organisms to
                   increasing urbanization over the coming decades.},

                   potentially enable individuals to deal with novel
                   situations. This implies that establishment of a
                   population in a new environment is aided by plastic
                   responses, as first suggested by Baldwin (1896). In
                   the early 1980s, a small population of dark-eyed
                   juncos from a temperate, montane environment became
                   established in a Mediterranean climate in coastal San
                   Diego. The breeding season of coastal juncos is more
                   than twice as long as that of the ancestral
                   population, and they fledge approximately twice as
                   many young. We investigated the adaptive significance
                   of the longer breeding season and its consequences
                   for population persistence. Within the coastal
                   population, individuals with longer breeding seasons
                   have higher offspring production and recruitment,
                   with no measured detrimental effects such as higher
                   mortality or lower reproductive success the following
                   year. Population size has remained approximately
                   constant during the 6 years of study (1998-2003). The
                   increase in reproductive effort in the coastal
                   population contributes substantially to the
                   persistence of this population because there is no
                   evidence of density-dependent recruitment, which
                   would otherwise negate the effects of increased
                   fledgling production. These results provide the first
                   quantitative support of Baldwin's proposition that
                   plasticity can be crucial for population persistence
                   during the early stages of colonization.},

  abstract =      {1. Clutch sizes generally increase with latitude, and
                   are smaller at southern latitudes compared with
                   equivalent northern ones. 2. Descriptions of such
                   patterns and attempts to identify their causal
                   mechanisms are complicated as different species, with
                   different ecological traits are often compared in
                   different regions. We reduce such problems by using
                   the introduction of 11 passerine species from the UK
                   to New Zealand as a natural experiment to explore
                   interspecific geographical variation in clutch size.
                   3. Nine species have significantly smaller clutches
                   in New Zealand than the UK. Sea- sonality, measured
                   both by climate and how birds respond to variation in
                   resource availability, is also lower in New Zealand.
                   Comparing across species, the magnitude of clutch
                   size change is unrelated to the magnitude of reduced
                   seasonality that each spe- cies experiences. 4. Such
                   observations are partly compatible with Ashmole's
                   hypothesis that areas with high seasonality have
                   large clutch sizes (higher winter mortality results
                   in a breeding popu- lation that is significantly
                   lower than the environment's carrying capacity, and
                   hence in extra resources for rearing chicks).
                   However, additional data on seasonal changes in
                   resource availability and population densities,
                   combined with comparative data on survival and nest
                   predation rates, are required to evaluate fully the
                   mechanisms generating smaller clutches in the
                   southern hemisphere. We discuss the potential
                   determinants of geographical variation in the
                   patterns of temporal variation in clutch size.},

                   bison) of Yellowstone National Park have lived in an
                   environment free of wolves (Canis lupus) for the last
                   50 years. In the winter of 1994–1995, wolves were
                   reintroduced into parts of Yellowstone National Park.
                   Foraging theory predicts that elk and bison would
                   respond to this threat by in- creasing their
                   vigilance levels. We tested this prediction by
                   comparing vigilance levels of elk and bison in areas
                   with wolves with those of elk still in
                   “wolf-free” zones of the Park. Male elk and bison
                   showed no response to the reintro- duction of wolves,
                   maintaining the lowest levels of vigilance throughout
                   the study (≈12 and 7{\%} of the time was spent
                   vigilant, respectively). Female elk and bison showed
                   significantly higher vigilance levels in areas with
                   wolves than in areas without wolves. The highest
                   vigilance level (47.5 ± 4.1{\%}; mean ± SE) was
                   seen by the second year for female elk with calves in
                   the areas with wolves and was maintained during the
                   subsequent 3 years of the study. As wolves ex- panded
                   into non-wolf areas, female elk with and without
                   calves in these areas gradually increased their
                   vigilance levels from initially 20.1 ± 3.5 and 11.5
                   ± 0.9{\%} to 43.0 ± 5.9 and 30.5 ± 2.8{\%} by the
                   fifth year of the study, respectively. We discuss the
                   possible reasons for the differences seen among the
                   social groups. We suggest that these behavioural re-
                   sponses to the presence of wolves may have more
                   far-reaching consequences for elk and bison ecology
                   than the actual killing of individuals by wolves.},
