## Thesis

In this repository you can find the LaTex files needed for generating the pdf of my dissertation. The layout is based on the Maggi Memoir Thesis template:

https://www.latextemplates.com/template/maggi-memoir-thesis

The file that needs to be compiled is Tesis.tex, or either, tesis_noappendix.tex. Each of these files generates a different pdf layout: tesis generates full a4 pages and includes the whole set of appendices. tesis_noappendix generates a4 pages with trim marks for printing to book size, and does not include appendices. In the associated folder Chapters there is one .tex file for each chapter and configuration, including the introduction and the general discussion, and the appendices. I guess you can tell the contents of the folder Figures. Some details of the layout, the packages that need to be loaded, and other details, can be found in the file structure_notrim_small_margins.tex, or its sister file structure_book_08reduction_centered.tex (sorry for the long names!).

I used the bibliography style of a well known journal in ecology, The American Naturalist, with the file amnat.bst. I also append the bib file of my whole reference list, full_library.bib.
