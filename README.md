## Thesis

In this repository you can find the LaTex files needed for generating the pdf of
my doctoral dissertation. The layout is based on the Maggi Memoir Thesis 
template and reused from the thesis of [David Garcia 
Callejas](https://github.com/garciacallejas/Thesis):

The file that needs to be compiled is tesis.tex. In the associated folder
Chapters there is one .tex file for each chapter and configuration, including
the introduction and the general discussion, and the appendices. I guess you can
tell the contents of the folder Figures. Some details of the layout, the
packages that need to be loaded, and other details, can be found in the file
structure_notrim_small_margins.tex.

I used the bibliography style of a well known journal in ecology, The American 
Naturalist, with the file amnat.bst. I also append the bib file of the whole 
reference list, library.bib.

Latex environment dependencies in Ubuntu:
- texlive-latex-extra
