Wood density was not as good a measure. Longevity of gymnosperms was predicted by resistance to wood decay. For both taxa there was a negative correlation between growth rate and longevity, supporting the hypothesis of growth trade-offs. Age of sexual maturity was closely predicted by longevity in angiosperms. There was no such relationship for conifers as a whole, though there was for pines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\

When  adult survival is held constant by partial correlation, high juvenile mortality is associated with short gestation lengths, small young in large but light-weight litters, early weaning and early maturity. In contrast, adult mortality correlates significantly with age of maturity but nothing else. Gestation length, ages at weaning and maturity, and neonatal body weight all covary with survival rate even after body-size effects have been removed by partial correlation. The results of these comparisons provide further evidence for a slow-fast continuum in life-history strategies independent of size. & Litter size, litter weight and neonatal weight respond differently to mortality. Litter size increases with higher mortality while neonatal weight decreases with higher mortality. There seems to be a direct trade-off between offspring number and weight. For a litter of a given weight, metabolic costs to the mother may be similar but the time spent on  producing large offspring is considerably longer than the time spent on producing small ones. If the chances of survival are good, a mother can afford to make a large neonate, with high competitive ability. If survival is unpredictable then a large litter or very small neonates will afford the possibility of high fitness in good years, but minimize maternal losses in bad years. & Delay reproduction when efficiency is greater for older animals.  LH strategies can be self-reinforcing (Horn, 1978). With the effects of body weight held constant, juvenile mortality was more highly correlated with LH traits relating to neonatal growth (litter size, neonatal weight and gestation length) than was adult mortality. Adult mortality was more highly correlated with LH traits relating to strategies for long-term reproductive output (age at maturity, inter-litter interval and lifetime reproductive output). The patterns could indicate that some LH traits are mainly responsible for mortality while others are a response to mortality. The former would correlate with juvenile mortality and the latter would correlate with adult mortality.\\ \\ Intrinsic mortality refers to that wich is primarily due to choices of resource allocation which and individual makes, that is the survival cost of reproduction.\\ \\ need for distinghishing environmental causes of mortality and the way in which decisions made by individuals may affect their own and their offspring's survival. \\

Species at the 'fast' end start to breed younger and produce more frequent, larger clutches of smaller eggs, with species at the 'slow' end doing the exact opposite (Partridge \& Harvey, 1988; Harvey et al., 1989). Fast-slow continuum for parasitoids predicts that fecund species should also (1) invest less in each offspring, (2) reproduce more quickly, and (3) start to reproduce earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\

In contrast, the survival habitat of the survivorship species are very good, but the breeding habitats are poor. The bet-hedging species live in favourable breeding and survival habitats, but the annual variation in the quality of the breeding habitats is very large, favouring the evolution of a larger clutch size than in the survivorship species. altricial birds, the key-factor appears during the non-breeding season. In contrast, in precocial birds key-factors from the breeding season explained a higher proportion of the variance in the total losses than the losses during the non-breeding season. In the majority of the cases density-dependence was found in the losses during the non-breeding Season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\
